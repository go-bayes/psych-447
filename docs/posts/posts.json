You can run any mathematical operation you would normally use by entering it into the console:\n\n\n## Addition\nx = 3 + 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n## Subtraction\nx = 3 - 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n## Multiplication\nx = 3 * 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 6\n\n## Division\nx = 3 / 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 1.5\n\n## Modulus (Remainder from division)\nx = 3 %% 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n## Exponentiation\nx = 3 ^ 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 9\n\n## Integer Division (Number of times denominator fits in numerator)\nx = 3 %/% 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 1\n\nInspecting data\nIn a moment, we’ll teach you how to import data into R.

This structure represents the foundation of most operations in R.\nInstead calling the mean function as above one could manually add all values of x dividing it by the number of x values.\nNevertheless, this would be very cumbersome.\nFor this reason, functions (pre-assembled lines of code) exist to reduce the amount of coding necessary.\nThese functions can be bundled into packages. R’s capacity for creating packages is main appeal of R as a statistical tool because community developed functions are available from a central repository called CRAN in the form of packages.\nThese packages can be installed in R with the command install.packages(“package name”).\nIt is important that you only need to install a package once on your machine, expect if you want to upgrade the package. Generally speaking you regularly want to upgrade your packages, but keep a permanent note in your code which version of a package you used when it was initially written.\nInstalling package\ninstall these packages (we’ll be using them later)\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\") # installing packages\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\") # installing packages\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\") ## data wrangling and visualisation\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"lme4\") # multilevel modelling\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"patchwork\") # arranging multiple graphs\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(\"strengejacke/sjPlot\") # plots and tables\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"papaja\")  # writing APA documents\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"table1\") # summary tables\n\n\n\nextra credit\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"easystats/easystats\")\n\n\n\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"strengejacke/ggeffects\")\n\n\n\nsuper extra credit\n\n\nif (!requireNamespace(\"remotes\")) {\n  install.packages(\"remotes\")\n}\nremotes::install_github(\"paul-buerkner/brms\")\n\n\n\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"stan-dev/cmdstanr\")\n\n\n\nRolling your own code\nLet’s use R to write a function. Recall that a factorial for a number \\(n\\) is the product of all positive inters less than or equal to \\(n\\). Thus the factorial for 5 = \\[1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5\\]\nIn R we can write a function:\n\n\n# create a function to perform the factorial operation \ngo_factorial <- function(x) {\n  y <- 1\n  for (i in 1:x) {\n    y <- y * ((1:x)[i])\n  }\n  print(y)\n}\n\n\n\nLet’s try it out\n\n\n# test of the `go_factorial` function\ngo_factorial(5)\n\n\n[1] 120\n\nLet’s see if this is the number that R’s factorial function produces:\n\n\n# R's native factorial function\nfactorial(5)\n\n\n[1] 120\n\nWe can use R’s == relational operator to evaluate whether the two functions are the same\n\n\n# are the two functions equivalent for factorial five\ngo_factorial(5) == factorial(5)\n\n\n[1] 120\n[1] TRUE\n\nFor more information about relational operators type the following into your console:\n\n\n?`==`\n\n\n\nWe can make more complicated functions:\n\n\n# function for factorial that throws warnings when the data that are entered are not appropriate. \ngo_bayes_factorial <- function (x) {\n  # check is the number is negative, positive or zero\n  if (x  < 0) {\n    print(\"not even Ashley Bloomfield could make a factorial for a negative number\")\n  } else if (x == 0) {\n    print(\"the factorial of zero is defined as 1\")\n  } else {\n    for (i in 1:x)\n      y <- 1\n    for (i in 1:x) {\n      y <- y * ((1:x)[i])\n    }\n    print(y)\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nWe’ll come back to functions later. It’s useful to look at an example of a function so that you can see that R is much more than a calcultor. It is a tool to empower you for doing data anlysis in new and creative ways.\nCoding etiquette\nKeep your code legible and annotate\nWhy is this bad code?\n\n\ndf1<-data.frame(a=rnorm(10,1,1),b=rnorm(10,4,8),c=rnorm(10,8,1),d=rnorm(10,7,2))\n\n\n\nWhy is this better code?\n\n\n# Create a data frame with four columns of randomly generated numbers specifying different means and standard deviations \ndf1 <- data.frame(\n  a = rnorm( 10, mean = 1, sd = 1 ),\n  b = rnorm( 10, mean = 4, sd = 8 ),\n  c = rnorm( 10, mean = 8, sd = 1 ),\n  d = rnorm( 10, mean = 7, sd = 2 )\n)\n\n\n\nusing R!\ndata summary\n\n\n# basic summary\nsummary(iris)\n\n\n  Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   \n Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  \n 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  \n Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  \n Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  \n 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  \n Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  \n       Species  \n setosa    :50  \n versicolor:50  \n virginica :50  \n                \n                \n                \n\n\n\ntable1::table1(~ Sepal.Length   + Sepal.Width   + Petal.Length  + Petal.Width |Species, data = iris  )\n\n\n\nsetosa(N=50)\nversicolor(N=50)\nvirginica(N=50)\nOverall(N=150)\nSepal.Length\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n5.01 (0.352)\n5.94 (0.516)\n6.59 (0.636)\n5.84 (0.828)\nMedian [Min, Max]\n5.00 [4.30, 5.80]\n5.90 [4.90, 7.00]\n6.50 [4.90, 7.90]\n5.80 [4.30, 7.90]\nSepal.Width\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n3.43 (0.379)\n2.77 (0.314)\n2.97 (0.322)\n3.06 (0.436)\nMedian [Min, Max]\n3.40 [2.30, 4.40]\n2.80 [2.00, 3.40]\n3.00 [2.20, 3.80]\n3.00 [2.00, 4.40]\nPetal.Length\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n1.46 (0.174)\n4.26 (0.470)\n5.55 (0.552)\n3.76 (1.77)\nMedian [Min, Max]\n1.50 [1.00, 1.90]\n4.35 [3.00, 5.10]\n5.55 [4.50, 6.90]\n4.35 [1.00, 6.90]\nPetal.Width\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n0.246 (0.105)\n1.33 (0.198)\n2.03 (0.275)\n1.20 (0.762)\nMedian [Min, Max]\n0.200 [0.100, 0.600]\n1.30 [1.00, 1.80]\n2.00 [1.40, 2.50]\n1.30 [0.100, 2.50]\n\n\n\n\n# plot relationship (what is happening here? )\nplot( Sepal.Length   ~ Sepal.Width , data = iris )\n\n\n\n\nmodel\n\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")  # plotting\nlibrary(\"ggeffects\")  # plotting\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")  # plotting\nlibrary(\"patchwork\") # arrange multiple plots\nlibrary(\"sjPlot\")  # tables and plots\n\n# basic model\nm1<- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)\nsummary(m1)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.5561 -0.6333 -0.1120  0.5579  2.2226 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

You might quickly feel lost. Don’t worry about. We only expect you to acquire the basics this week.\nRmarkdown workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nFor those of you who always wanted to learn R but never thought they could, this course is for you.\nHow will you benefit from this course?\nYou’ll learn how to use R, and Github, and we’ll teach you the fundamentals of statistics with a focus thinking not on rules.\nYou’ll learn how to learn – that is, how to obtain the resources you need to address a problem at hand.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll know how to:\nData skills:\nperform your data analysis in R\ndocument your analysis and collaborate in GitHub\ncreate a publication-ready article, with tables and graphs\ncreate a free personal website on github.\nStatistical skills:\nlearn the importance of knowing your question\nlearn how to collect data that bears on your question\nlearn how to explore your data visually\nlearn how to avoid common modelling pitfalls\nlearn how to improve your inference using multi-level models\nOur approach to teaching and learning\n\n\nThis course is designed to provide you with basic understanding, useful tips, and some guide rails for learning. Our main task is to give you the confidence, and the inspiration, for independent learning.\nWhat is R?\nIn a nutshell\nR is a free programming language and software environment for statistical computing (for download links see here: Windows, Mac).\nHistory\nR is the brainchild of Ross Ihaka and [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician). It was created at the University of Auckland, where Ross Ihaka remains a professor of statistics.\nPurpose\nR was conceived to be a flexible language for data analysis usable by researchers. Since the initial beta release of R in 2000 the language has gained substantial popularity inside and outside of academia (have a look at this blog post for an interesting analysis). New versions of R are released periodically and can be downloaded and installed to replace the older R version.\nWhat is R Studio?\nThe IDE\nThe are many ways for using R on your computer. For the purposes of getting started, we will be using the Integrated Development Environment (IDE): R Studio.\nR Studio provides an interface with a number of user-friendly options, including a separate console and editor that has various help and syntax-auto-complete functions, and various tools for plotting, history, data visualization, debugging and work space management. It is important to remember that R and R Studio are not the same thing.\n\nA quick walk through R Studio\n\n\nGitHub\nWhat is Git/GitHub?\nGithub is a version control system. It is similar to Google docs, though for code. It is useful for collaboration because code easily breaks. It is only rarely possible to simultaneously work in real time on the same code because it will eventually break. Where and how is not easy to assess.\nA second function of GitHub is that it allows us to reconstruct histories of analysis. This is critical for open and reproducible science. This is the main function that we will be examining here.\nA third function, which pertains to single users, is that when writing code you can rewind and recover from your mistakes. This will save you a whole lot of time in the end.\nNote that GitHub has an interface with Rstudio. You will be using GitHub with Rstudio throughout this course.\nInstall Git\nWe suggested installing the educational version because this will allow you to have private repositories.\nIf you haven’t done that, but want to get started you can open a free account and retrospectively add your educational account later.\nPRO TIP Pick a user name that will be OK for professional purposes. If in doubt use your name.\nDirections for installing Git can be found http://github.com\nCreate a repository\nFirst create a repository on GitHub\n\n\n\nNext copy the location\n\n\n\nThen open a new project in Rstudio as a GitHub project\n\n\n\nThen open an Rmarkdown document, write and save it\nFirst, make sure that Rmarkdown is installed:\n\n\n# run this code\nif (!requireNamespace(\"devtools\"))\n  install.packages('devtools')\ndevtools::install_github('rstudio/rmarkdown')\n\n\n\nNext, create a document\n\n\n\nMake sure you save your document\nPress ⌘ + S  is the command for “save”\nThen commit your Rmarkdown document by including a message, and “pushing” to GitHub\nNote that we don’t want want to push .Rproj files to GitHub (this will mess up your collaborations), so I edited my .gitignore file.\nTypically you won’t want to be pushing large html files back and forth to GitHub (that can cause GitHub to freeze).\nYou can edit your gitingore file by adding a * like so:\n/*.html\nsee: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitig\nNext commit!\n\n\n\nVoila!\nExtra information\nJB’s recommendations for using Git and Rstudio\nThis is a very good tutorial on github and Rstudio: link\nVideo link\nA very brief setup video for Mac Users Link\nJK’s recommendations for using Git and Rstuio\nsetup\nRMarkdown\nWhat is Rmarkdown?\nIn the example above we breezed through Rmarkdown without exampling it. What is Rmarkdown?\nRmarkdown is a format for combining data-analysis with ordinary writing using a simple markup language.\nThe Rmarkdown code we used to write the opening paragraph looks like this.\n\ndiv.blue{ background-color:#e6f0ff}\n\n## To do\nRead Danielle Navarro's brief account of \nRmarkdown [here](https://slides.djnavarro.net/starting-rmarkdown/#8)\n\nThe:\n\n##\n\nmakes a heading. Then we write as we ordinarily would write:\n\nRead Danielle Navarro’s brief account of Rmarkdown\n\nand we include a link by typing\n\n[here](https://slides.djnavarro.net/starting-rmarkdown/#8)\n\nThink of rmarkdown as writing in word but without having to use your mouse all the time, and you can write up your analysis while writing in a one0stop shop.\nRmarkdown is just an efficient method for composing text without having to reach for your mouse, and a way of documenting and reporting your analysis\nWhy is Rmarkdown useful?\nRmarkdown merges two very powerful ideas: 1. R as a coding based tool to make your analysis repeatable; 2. markdown an approach to writing text that allows for the direct embedding of code output.\nThis is an immensely powerful approach that can be used for everything, from writing research papers, to writing complex technical documentation. This website is written Rmarkdown.\nYou will be creating a website similar to Johannes Karl’swebsite and Joseph Bulbulia’s websiteand you will do this by written using Rmarkdown).\nYou might think that writing in R markdown is only a nice technical trick for people really into coding, but in reality it addresses a central problem of statistical analysis.\nThe majority of errors in quantitative research papers (some meta-researchers indicate values as high as 80%) are human errors in transcribing values from the statistical software they are using to the final document (for a marginally entertaining story around this issue see this post).\nExtra information\ncoding tips Rmarkdown website\nJB’s recommendation for a very short introduction to Rmarkdown: https://rpubs.com/bpbond/626346\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips and tricks (JB)\nOne day, someone might ask you to collaborate in \\(\\LaTeX\\) (pronounced “Lay-Tek”). \\(\\LaTeX\\) is a document preparation system developed by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s that uses \\(\\TeX\\), a typesetting system that Donald Knuth developed in the 1970s to create mathematical documents. Writing in LaTeX is only a little more complicated than writing in markdown. For example, instead of writing # Heading, ## Subheading, ## Subsubheading, you would write \\section{Heading} \\subsection{Subheading}, \\subsubsection{Subsubheading}. However, the principles of mouseless composition that make Rmarkdown so nice, also make LaTeX nice. Rmarkdown shares features for bibliographic referencing with LaTeX that we’ll cover in later weeks. For now, since we are teaching you about Rmarkdown, we thought it’d be useful to teach about LaTeX too. Stay tuned for more.\nFinal thought: why quantitative psychology has to change (Why can’t I use SPSS, JK)\nQuantitative psychology has long struggled with replicability of it’s results both in substantive and also statistical areas. Concerns around these topics have already been raised on works by authors such as Joseph Banks Rhine the founder of modern parapsychology in the 1930s. Numerous authors, even at the time criticized both methods of the experiment and of the analysis [@gulliksenExtraSensoryPerceptionWhat1938]. In modern times, Deryl Bem’s article “Feeling the Future” that reported evidence in favor of Extra Sensory Perception revived this debate and led to an increased uptake of Open Science methods. Importantly, this is not only an issue in psychology, but instead affects all quantitative fields such as biology, chemistry, and physics. Out of the many issues that are addressed as part of the open science movement (if you are interested in getting active in it have a look at ANZORN) we will focus mostly on aspects of reproducability in analysis.\nUntil recently IBMs SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), which originally launched in 1968 dominated the research space in psychology. If you never had the fortune of working with SPSS this is what it looked like:\n\n\n\nSPSS presented the user with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) through which they could run tests on their data. The big issue was that each statistical test has many different options researchers can choose (you will often hear people talk about researcher degrees of freedom) and a GUI makes it very difficult to accurately record every small setting a researcher has chosen. As a work around researchers could either store their output of the analysis which recorded some settings, but even for moderately complex analysis this output could stretch in the hundredth of pages. Alternatively, researchers could save the underlying code that SPSS used, but this was also very clunky and extremely arcane to understand. To give you a sense of scope below you see a snippet from a widely used analysis in SPSS aimed at examining the similarity of factor structures across groups. This code has a total of 130 lines that researchers would have needed to largely enter by hand and double check for any potential coding errors.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, some changes made by researchers were extremely difficult to account for. For example, when a researcher re-coded a variable say reversing its direction there was no way of knowing that this had taken place if you later looked at the data set. Together with the rise in complex analysis in psychology this has led to a steady decline in the use of SPSS and most psychology departments, as well as private, and governmental stake holder now require a certain fluency in R or similar coding based languages.\nFinal though\nR, Rstudio, GitHub, R-markdown \\(\\dots\\) these are just tools that fit our task\nOur main task in this course is to develop statistical intuition and workflows that will enable you to do better science.\nLecture slides\nClick here to go to the lecture slides.\n\n\n\nfitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});\n\nWeekly problem sets\n** Note we will be working with you in the first week’s workshop to get you through this assessment task.

You can run any mathematical operation you would normally use by entering it into the console:\n\n\n## Addition\nx = 3 + 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n## Subtraction\nx = 3 - 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n## Multiplication\nx = 3 * 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 6\n\n## Division\nx = 3 / 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 1.5\n\n## Modulus (Remainder from division)\nx = 3 %% 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n## Exponentiation\nx = 3 ^ 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 9\n\n## Integer Division (Number of times denominator fits in numerator)\nx = 3 %/% 2\nx\n\n\n[1] 1\n\nThe basic structure of R commands\nWhile using R as calculator might be interesting, it does not get us very far in analysing our data.\nTo really unlock the full potential of R we first need to understand the basic structure of most R code and learn some terms.\nThe four main elements of every R code are:\nobjects,\nfunctions,\narguments\noperators.\nFigure 1 provides a simple example, that produces a new object which contains the mean of variable x.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Basic Syntax of R\n\n\n\nThe function mean generates the arithmetic mean of an input object.\nThe object needs to be specified inside of the function brackets as the x argument, in this case we define x = df .\nLast, we assign the result of this function for later us via the <- operator to an object which we decided to call object.\nIn other words, we create a new object that can be further manipulated and contains information about the mean of a previously created object “x”. This structure represents the foundation of most operations in R.\nInstead calling the mean function as above one could manually add all values of x dividing it by the number of x values.\nNevertheless, this would be very cumbersome.\nFor this reason, functions (pre-assembled lines of code) exist to reduce the amount of coding necessary.\nThese functions can be bundled into packages. R’s capacity for creating packages is main appeal of R as a statistical tool because community developed functions are available from a central repository called CRAN in the form of packages.\nThese packages can be installed in R with the command install.packages(“package name”).\nIt is important that you only need to install a package once on your machine, expect if you want to upgrade the package. Generally speaking you regularly want to upgrade your packages, but keep a permanent note in your code which version of a package you used when it was initially written.\nRecommended reading\nAn introduction to R and Rstudio\n\n\n\n",

The really great thing about Rmarkdown is that you can write document and do the analysis in a single stop shop. Figure 1 shows Rmarkdown in the rconsole (upper left).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of Rmarkdown document (upper left)\n\n\n\nRmarkdown and You\nRmarkdown merges two very powerful ideas: 1. R as a coding based tool to make your analysis repeatable; 2. markdown an approach to writing text that allows for the direct embedding of code output.\nThis is an immensely powerful approach that can be used for everything, from writing research papers, to writing complex technical documentation. This website is written Rmarkdown.\nYou will be creating a website similar to Johannes Karl’swebsite and Joseph Bulbulia’s websiteand you will do this by written using Rmarkdown).\nYou might think that writing in R markdown is only a nice technical trick for people really into coding, but in reality it addresses a central problem of statistical analysis.\nThe majority of errors in quantitative research papers (some meta-researchers indiate values as high as 80%) are human errors in transcribing values from the statistical software they are using to the final document (for a marginally entertaining story around this issue see this post).\nHow to keep track of everything\nNow that we have our repeatable code, our repeatable document, the last thing we need is a transparent way to document what we are doing and share with others. For that we come to our last tool that in a similar confusing way to R and Rstudio is split in to parts; git and Github.\nSome useful sites\ncoding tips Rmarkdown website\n\n\n\n",
