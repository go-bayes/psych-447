              for severe mental illness defined as a K6 score $\geq$ 13,
              estimated to afflict about 6\% of US adults. The K6, as currently
              used, fails to capture individuals struggling with more moderate
              mental distress that nonetheless warrants mental health
              intervention. The current study determined a cutoff criterion on
              the K6 scale indicative of moderate mental distress based on
              mental health treatment need and assessed the validity of this
              criterion by comparing participants with identified moderate and
              severe mental distress on relevant clinical, impairment, and risk
              behavior measures. Data were analyzed from 50,880 adult
              participants in the 2007 California Health Interview Survey.
              Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified K6
              $\geq$ 5 as the optimal lower threshold cut-point indicative of
              moderate mental distress. Based on the K6, 8.6\% of California
              adults had serious mental distress and another 27.9\% had
              moderate mental distress. Correlates of moderate and serious
              mental distress were similar. Respondents with moderate mental
              distress had rates of mental health care utilization, impairment,
              substance use and other risks lower than respondents with serious
              mental distress and greater than respondents with none/low mental
              distress. The findings support expanded use and analysis of the
              K6 scale in quantifying and examining correlates of mental
              distress at a moderate, yet still clinically relevant, level.",

              screening scale for serious mental illness (SMI) in the World
              Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. The
              K6 is a six-item scale developed to provide a brief valid screen
              for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th
              edition (DSM-IV) SMI based on the criteria in the US ADAMHA
              Reorganization Act. Although methodological studies have
              documented good K6 validity in a number of countries, optimal
              scoring rules have never been proposed. Such rules are presented
              here based on analysis of K6 data in nationally or regionally
              representative WMH surveys in 14 countries (combined N = 41,770
              respondents). Twelve-month prevalence of DSM-IV SMI was assessed
              with the fully-structured WHO Composite International Diagnostic
              Interview. Nested logistic regression analysis was used to
              generate estimates of the predicted probability of SMI for each
              respondent from K6 scores, taking into consideration the
              possibility of variable concordance as a function of respondent
              age, gender, education, and country. Concordance, assessed by
              calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic
              curve, was generally substantial (median 0.83; range 0.76-0.89;
              inter-quartile range 0.81-0.85). Based on this result, optimal
              scaling rules are presented for use by investigators working with

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A 10-question screening scale of psychological
              distress and a six-question short-form scale embedded within the
              10-question scale were developed for the redesigned US National
              Health Interview Survey (NHIS). METHODS: Initial pilot questions
              were administered in a US national mail survey (N = 1401). A
              reduced set of questions was subsequently administered in a US
              national telephone survey (N = 1574). The 10-question and
              six-question scales, which we refer to as the K10 and K6, were
              constructed from the reduced set of questions based on Item
              Response Theory models. The scales were subsequently validated in
              a two-stage clinical reappraisal survey (N = 1000 telephone
              screening interviews in the first stage followed by N = 153
              face-to-face clinical interviews in the second stage that
              oversampled first-stage respondents who screened positive for
              emotional problems) in a local convenience sample. The
              second-stage sample was administered the screening scales along
              with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). The K6
              was subsequently included in the 1997 (N = 36116) and 1998 (N =
              32440) US National Health Interview Survey, while the K10 was
              included in the 1997 (N = 10641) Australian National Survey of
              Mental Health and Well-Being. RESULTS: Both the K10 and K6 have
              good precision in the 90th-99th percentile range of the
              population distribution (standard errors of standardized scores
              in the range 0.20-0.25) as well as consistent psychometric
              properties across major sociodemographic subsamples. The scales
              strongly discriminate between community cases and non-cases of
              DSM-IV/SCID disorders, with areas under the Receiver Operating
              Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.87-0.88 for disorders having
              Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores of 0-70 and
              0.95-0.96 for disorders having GAF scores of 0-50. CONCLUSIONS:
              The brevity, strong psychometric properties, and ability to
              discriminate DSM-IV cases from non-cases make the K10 and K6
              attractive for use in general-purpose health surveys. The scales
              are already being used in annual government health surveys in the
              US and Canada as well as in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys.
              Routine inclusion of either the K10 or K6 in clinical studies
              would create an important, and heretofore missing, crosswalk
              between community and clinical epidemiology.",
