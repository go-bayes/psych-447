We start with basic coding and workflow protocols, data wrangling and visualisation, and elementary regression, and gradually progress to more complex multilevel models. The practical skills you acquire will prepare you for advanced research in psychological science as well as for work in other areas of science, government, and industry. No prior familiarity with R or computer programming is required.\nWhere to find material\nWeekly lectures and course resources are located here\nWeekly problem sets are located here\nAssements\nWeekly journal entries (about 100 - 200 words) (10 X journals = 10%)\nFormat: you will document your insights, questions, and frustrations in a weekly journal. This record should include how you have sought help to address your questions, and how you have offered help. The purpose of the journals are to cultivate skills for interacting with the R community, and for documenting the research process.\nWeekly problem sets You will find the problem sets Here. (10 x problem sets = 50%)\nFinal project consisting of:\nA short report of an analysis of a research question using a dataset (problem and dataset to be developed with your instructors by March 30th): 20%\nA 7 minute class presentation of your report: 10%\nA github website profiling your CV: 10%\nYou will find a description of the project TBA.\nCommunication of additional information and submissions\nLectures will be posted to: https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-423/\nCourse-related notices will appear on VUW Blackboard\nAny information relating to Psyc 447or any last-minute changes to the course will be posted on Blackboard.\nStudents must submit all written work to VUW Blackboard.\nImportant dates\nTrimester dates: 22 February to 20 June Teaching dates: 22 February to 28 May\nMid-trimester break: 5 April to 18 April\nLast assessment item due: Final assessment (research proposal) will need to be submitted on 31st May (see Assessments)\nStudy Examination/Assessment Period: Note: students who enrol in courses with examinations must be able to attend an examination at the University at any time during the scheduled examination period. Withdrawal dates: Refer to Withdrawing If you cannot complete an assignment or sit a test or examination (aegrotats), refer to Aegrotats\nTeaching Format\nPsyc423 is a 15pt course which represents approx. 150 hours of total work for an average student.\nIn-class time involves (approx. 22hrs):\nLectures by academic staff: Lectures will introducing the topics. These will be based on weekly readings.\nClass participation: you need to follow the lectures or else you will risk falling behind.\nWorkshops/labs: the weekly workshops/labs are where you will receive hands on training. Again, you need to attend or follow these or else you will risk falling behind.\nOut-of-class time involves (approx. 128hrs):\nReading articles before & following class.\nJournal entries x 10\nProblem sets/workbooks x 10\nFinal project\nMandatory course requirements\nThere are no mandatory course requirements.\nWorkload\nGiven that Psyc 447 is a 15 point course, the expected workload is no less than 150 hours in total. This would mean roughly 15 hours per week. This should be viewed as a minimum - how much you get out of this course will depend on the work you put in.\nPenalties\nStudents must turn in all assignments on time by due dates. If students do not turn in an essay or assignment at a designated time, they will receive a zero for assignment this will be counted toward the final grade.\nMaterials and equipment and/or additional expenses\nComputer a personal computer will be essential for completing this course. If you do not have access to a personal computer let your instructor know as soon as possible.\nA github education account will be useful, even if not strictly necessary.\nYou should apply for a github education account as soon as possible here: https://education.github.com/pack/offers\nRecommended reading\nMost of the material students will be expected to read is published in journals academic websites and, in some cases, in books. Students will generally need to read between one and five articles per week. Set readings will mostly be supplied throughout the course (please check this website). However, students will also be required to conduct their own independent reviews of the literature for assignment purposes.\nOther important information\nThe information above is specific to this course. There is other important information that students must familiarise themselves with, including:\nAcademic Integrity/Plagiarism\nAcademic Progress\nDates and deadlines\nFaculty of Science Student and Academic Services Office\nGrades\nSpecial passes Refer to the Assessment Handbook\nStatutes and policies\nStudent support\nStudents with disabilities\nStudent Charter\nTerms and Conditions\nTurnitin\nUniversity structure\nVUWSA\nWhat do I need to do\nAttend Lectures\nLecture dates are:\nFEB 23\nMAR 2\nMAR 9\nMAR 16\nMAR 23\nMAR 30\nBREAK\nAPRI 20\nAPRIL 27\nMAY 4\nMAY 11\nMAY 18: Presentations\nMAY 25: Presentations\nAttend Weekly labs\nThere will be a 1.5-hour practicum each week in which students cultivate their skills by applying what the learn to data. Learning applied statistics in R is like learning a language. Progress comes from immersing yourself in the language. You need to speak often, and you need to make lots of mistakes. The weekly labs will provide you with opportunity to do R. The labs will consist of problem sets that we will do together.\nThe weekly labs on the Wednesdays after the Tuesday lectures.\nCommplete weekly “workbooks”\nWeekly assignments allow you to further develop you skills, and to build the statistical intuitions that will enable them to flexibly address a broad range of scientific problems.\nThe focus of these assignments will be on thinking about coding and statistics, documenting requests for help, and offers for help.\nProject\nThe course culminates with an in-depth project in which students work on data from their own area of interest combining R with contemporary tools of collaborative (GitHub) and open science (OSF). Student presentations will afford students with the opportunity to present their projects and offer each other constructive feedback.\nOutline\nWeek 1 (a): Introduction: R and you\nWho will benefit from this course?\nWhat is R?\nDownloading R and Rstudio (what is the difference).\nWhat is GitHub\nWhy do I need these tools?\nWeek 1 (b): R basics\nUsing R as a calculator\nCreating (and saving) a project using Rstudio\nLoading Data\nThe basics of your workflow\nWeek 1 (c): R Markdown\nThe elements of Rmarkdown\nYour first Rmarkdown document\nGitHub\nPackages\nWeek 2 (a): Data visualisation\nData visualisation with ggplot2\nCreating a graph\nLayers\nFacets\nUnderstanding your data through graphs…\nUSEFUL\nWeek 2 (b): Coding basics\nBasic types of data in R\nNumbers and integers\n\nFactors (ordered, unordered)\nCharacters\nLists, Arrays, Matrices & data frames\nAssignment\nFunctions\nCoding etiquette… etc\n\nWeek 3 (a): Data transformation\nPipe operators\nSelect, filter, operators, missing values, arrange.\nMutate & data transformation\nTidy data\nWeek 3 (b): Rolling your own functions: when, why, and how\nWeek 4: CONSOLODATION OF SKILLS IN R\nWeek 5 (a): Samples and parameters: observation and inference\nWeek 5 (b): Linear and non-linear relationships with one co-variate\nWeek 6 (a): Two covariates & the spectre of confounding\nWeek 6 (b): An introduction to causal DAGS (using ggdag)\nWeek 7 (a): Modelling binary data\nWeek 7 (b): Modelling count data + zero inflation\nWeek 8 (a): Introduction to multilevel models: group-level intercepts\nWeek 8 (b): Introduction to multilevel models: group-level slopes\nWeek 9 (a): Multivariate multilevel regression.\nWeek 9 (b): Longitudinal inference: within and between-individual effects, the when and when-not of mediation.\nWeek 10 (a): Missing data and other measurement opportunities.\nWeek 10 (b): CONSOLIDATION OF STATISTICS\nWeek 11: Student presentations of projects: using Rstudio & GitHub/OSF\nWeek 12: Student presentations of projects: using Rstudio & GitHub/OSF\nAcknowledgments\nSome code used in creating this course website comes from: Matti Vuorre (former VUW psych student): https://vuorre.netlify.app/\nStatistical approaches: Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking: https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2020\n\n\n\n",
