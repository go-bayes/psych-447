We start with basic coding and workflow protocols, data wrangling and visualisation, and elementary regression, and gradually progress to more complex multilevel models. The practical skills you acquire will prepare you for advanced research in psychological science as well as for work in other areas of science, government, and industry. No prior familiarity with R or computer programming is required.\nWhere to find material\nWeekly problem sets are located in the assessments directory\nWeekly lectures are in the _posts/ directory.\nWhat do I need to do\nAttend (or follow) Lectures\nEach week, students will attend (or follow) a weekly lecture.\nIn these lectures we will demonstrate how R works and cover basic principles of statistics. The goal is to enable students to use R to conduct psychological science.\nAttend Weekly labs\nThere will be a 2- hour practicum each week in which students cultivate their skills by applying what the learn to data. Learning applied statistics in R is like learning a language. Progress comes from immersing yourself in the langague You need to speak often, and you need to make lots of mistakes. The weekly labs will provide you with opportunity to do R. The labs will consist of problem sets that we will do together.\nCommplete weekly “workbooks”\nWeekly assignments allow you to further develop you skills, and to build the statistical intuitions that will enable them to flexibly address a broad range of scientific problems.\nThe focus of these assignments will be on thinking about coding and statistics, documenting requests for help, and offers for help.\nTests\nThere are 2 x tests which will offer the opportunity to consolidate the skills you’ll get from the workbooks. The format of the tests will be problem sets of the kind you will be getting in your workbooks.\nProject\nThe course culminates with an in-depth project in which students work on data from their own area of interest combining R with contemporary tools of collaborative (GitHub) and open science (OSF). Student presentations will afford students with the opportunity to present their projects and offer each other constructive feedback.\nOutline\nThe course outline is as follows\nWeek 1 (a): Introduction: R and you\nWho will benefit from this course?\nWhat is R?\nDownloading R and Rstudio (what is the difference).\nWhat is GitHub\nWhy do I need these tools?\nWeek 1 (b): Setting up\nUsing R as a calculator\nCreating (and saving) a project using Rstudio\nLoading Data\nThe basics of your workflow\nThe elements of Rmarkdown\nYour first Rmarkdown document\nGitHub\nPackages\nWeek 2 (a): Data visualisation\nData visualisation with ggplot2\nCreating a graph\nLayers\nFacets\nUnderstanding your data through graphs…\nUSEFUL\nWeek 2 (b): Coding basics\nBasic types of data in R\nNumbers and integers\n\nFactors (ordered, unordered)\nCharacters\nLists, Arrays, Matrices & data frames\nAssignment\nFunctions\nCoding etiquette… etc\n\nWeek 3 (a): Data transformation\nPipe operators\nSelect, filter, operators, missing values, arrange.\nMutate & data transformation\nTidy data\nWeek 3 (b): Rolling your own functions: when, why, and how\nTBA\nWeek 4: TEST\nWeek 5 (a): Samples and parameters: observation and inference\nWeek 5 (b): Linear and non-linear relationships with one co-variate\nWeek 6 (a): Two covariates & the spectre of confounding\nWeek 6 (b): An introduction to causal DAGS (using ggdag)\nWeek 7 (a): Modelling binary data\nWeek 7 (b): Modelling count data + zero inflation\nWeek 8 (a): Introduction to multilevel models: group-level intercepts\nWeek 8 (b): Introduction to multilevel models: group-level slopes\nWeek 9 (a): Multivariate multilevel regression.\nWeek 9 (b): Longitudinal inference: within and between-individual effects, the when and when-not of mediation.\nWeek 10 (a): Missing data and other measurement opportunities.\nWeek 10 (b): Test\nWeek 11: Student presentations of projects: using Rstudio & GitHub/OSF\nWeek 12: Student presentations of projects: using Rstudio & GitHub/OSF\nAcknowledgments\nSet up of site: Matti Vuorre (former VUW psych student): https://vuorre.netlify.app/\nStatistical approaches: Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking: https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2020\n\n\n\n",
