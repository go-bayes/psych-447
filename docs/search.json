We start with basic coding and workflow protocols, data wrangling and visualisation, and elementary regression, and gradually progress to more complex multilevel models. The practical skills you acquire will prepare you for advanced research in psychological science as well as for work in other areas of science, government, and industry. No prior familiarity with R or computer programming is required.\nWhere to find material\nWeekly lectures and course resources are located under the lecture tab here\n** Weekly workbooks can be found under the workbook tab [here] (https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-447/index_workbooks.html)\nAssessments\nSee information under the Assessments tab here: https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-447/assessments.html\nCommunication of additional information and submissions\nLectures will be posted to: https://github.com/go-bayes/psych-447\nCourse-related notices will appear on VUW Blackboard\nAny information relating to Psyc 447 or any last-minute changes to the course will be posted on Blackboard.\nWritten work will be submitted via Blackboard, unless otherwise specified.\nThe problem sets and journal are due every Friday during term at midnight.\nYou will be marked out of your best 10 x submissions for the problem sets Only 10 x journal entries will count.\nImportant dates\nTrimester dates: 22 February to 20 June Teaching dates: 22 February to 28 May\nMid-trimester break: 5 April to 18 April\nLast assessment item due: Final assessment (project) will need to be submitted on 31st May (see Assessments)\nStudy Examination/Assessment Period: Note: students who enrol in courses with examinations must be able to attend an examination at the University at any time during the scheduled examination period. Withdrawal dates: Refer to Withdrawing If you cannot complete an assignment or sit a test or examination (aegrotats), refer to Aegrotats\nTeaching format\nPsyc 447 is a 15pt course which represents approx. 150 hours of total work for an average student.\nIn-class time involves (approx. 22hrs):\nLectures by academic staff: Lectures will introducing the topics. These will be based on weekly readings.\nClass participation: you need to follow the lectures or else you will risk falling behind.\nWorkshops: the weekly workshops are where you will receive hands on training. Again, you need to attend or follow these or else you will risk falling behind.\nThis course will demand 128hrs outside of lecture/workshops:\nReading articles, (curated) R websites, and (curated) statistics websites before & following class.\nJournal entries x 10\nProblem sets/workbooks x 10\nFinal project x 1 (including class presentation)\nMandatory course requirements\nThere are no mandatory course requirements.\nWorkload\nGiven that Psyc 447 is a 15 point course, the expected workload is no less than 150 hours in total. This would mean roughly 15 hours per week. This should be viewed as a minimum - how much you get out of this course will depend on the work you put in.\nPenalties\nStudents must turn in all assignments on time by due dates. If students do not turn in an essay or assignment at a designated time, they will receive a zero for assignment this will be counted toward the final grade.\nMaterials and equipment and/or additional expenses\nComputer a personal computer will be essential for completing this course. If you do not have access to a personal computer let your instructor know as soon as possible.\nA github education account This will be useful, even if not strictly necessary (i.e. you can set up an ordinary github account)\nYou should apply for a github education account as soon as possible here: https://education.github.com/pack/offers\nRecommended reading\nMost of the material students will be expected to read is published in journals academic websites and, in some cases, in books. Students will generally need to read between one and five articles per week. Set readings will mostly be supplied throughout the course (please check this website). However, students will also be required to conduct their own independent reviews of the literature for assignment purposes.\nOther important information\nThe information above is specific to this course. There is other important information that students must familiarise themselves with, including:\nAcademic Integrity/Plagiarism\nAcademic Progress\nDates and deadlines\nFaculty of Science Student and Academic Services Office\nGrades\nSpecial passes Refer to the Assessment Handbook\nStatutes and policies\nStudent support\nStudents with disabilities\nStudent Charter\nTerms and Conditions\nTurnitin\nUniversity structure\nVUWSA\nWhat do you need to do?\nAttend lectures\nLecture dates are:\nFEB 23\nMAR 2\nMAR 9\nMAR 16\nMAR 23\nMAR 30\nBREAK\nAPRI 20\nAPRIL 27\nMAY 4\nMAY 11\nMAY 18\nMAY 25\nAttend weekly workshops\nThere will be a 1.5-hour practicum each week in which students cultivate their skills by applying what the learn to data. Learning applied statistics in R is like learning a language. Progress comes from immersing yourself in the language. You need to speak often, and you need to make lots of mistakes. The weekly workshops will provide you with opportunity to do R. The workshops will consist of your weekly problem sets + additional support. The are the place were we will help you individually and in groups, and were you will help each other.\nThe weekly labs on the Wednesdays after the Tuesday lectures.\nWorkshop dates:\nFEB 24\nMAR 3\nMAR 10\nMAR 17\nMAR 24\nMAR 31\nBREAK\nAPRI 21\nAPRIL 28\nMAY 5\nMAY 12\nMAY 19: (focus on your project)\nMAY 25: (focus on your project)\nComplete weekly workbooks and weekly journals\nWeekly assignments allow you to further develop you skills, and to build the statistical intuitions that will enable them to flexibly address a broad range of scientific problems.\nThe focus of these assignments will be on thinking about coding and statistics, documenting requests for help, and offers for help.\nFinal Project + Github CV\nThe course culminates with an in-depth project in which students work on data from their own area of interest combining R with contemporary tools of collaborative (GitHub) and open science (OSF). Student CVs will afford students with the opportunity to present themselves for employers or graduate school admissions committees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nSome code used in creating this course website comes from: Matti Vuorre (former VUW psych student!): https://vuorre.netlify.app/\nStatistical approaches owes a heavy debt to Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking: https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2020\n\n\n\n",
