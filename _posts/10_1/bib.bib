  abstract  = "Ordinal variables, although extremely common in psychology, are
               almost exclusively analyzed with statistical models that falsely
               assume them to be metric. This practice can lead to distorted
               effect-size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems.
               We argue for the application of ordinal models that make
               appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this
               Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal
               models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category
               models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully
               Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on
               opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage.
               The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the
               models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared
               with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical
               interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we
               recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.",
