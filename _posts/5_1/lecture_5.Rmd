## Overview

In Part 1 we will introduce regression.

In Part 2 we will:

-   learn how to use R to generate random numbers
-   use random numbers to simulate data

## Learning outcomes

By learning regression, you will better equipped to do psychological science and to evaluate psychological research.

By *beginning* to learn how to simulate data you will better understand how what a regression model is doing, to evaluate your regression model, and to plan research. Note, that we will not expect you to simulate a dataset just yet. Instead, we will illustrate the use of tools for simulation, and ask that you try out very basic simulation functions. It will not be until after the April break that you will simulate any data for the purposes of assisting in statistical inference.

## Part 1: What is regression?

Broadly speaking, a regression model is method for inferring the expected average features of a population, and the variance of a population, conditional on other features of the a population as embodied in measurements obtained from a sample.

We'll see that regression encompasses more than this definition, however, the definition makes a start.

To understand regression we need to understand the following jargon words: population, sample, measurement, and inference.

#### What is a population?

In science, a population is a hypothetical construct. It is the set of all potential members of a set of things. In psychological science that set is typically a collection of individuals. We want to understand "The population of all human beings?" or "The New Zealand adult population"; or "The population of undergraduates who may be recruited for IPRP in New Zealand."

#### What is a sample?

A sample is a randomly realised sub-population from the larger abstract population that a scientific community hopes to generalise about.

Think of selecting balls randomly from an urn. If pulled at random, the balls may inform us about the contents of the urn. For example, if we select one white ball and one black ball, we may infer that the balls in the urn are not all white or all black.

#### What is "measurement"? 

A measure is tool or method for obtaining numerical descriptions of a sample. We often call measures "scales." We can think of a bathroom weight scale as a tool and method for tracking body weight.

A measurement is the numerical description we obtain from sensors such as statistical surveys, census data, twitter feeds, & etc.

In the course, we have encountered numerical scales, ordinal scales, and factors. The topic of measurement in psychological is, to say the least, very broad.

For now, it is important to keep in mind that, similar to bathroom scales, measures can be prone to error.

Also similar to bathroom scales, error prone scales may nevertheless be useful. We need to investigate the utility of error prone scales against the backdrop of specific interests and purposes.

#### What is a parameter? 

In regression, we combine measurements on samples with probability theory to guess about the properties of a population we will never observe. We call these properties "parameters."

#### What is statistical inference?

The bulk of statistical inference consists of educated guessing about population parameters.

#### Probability distributions and statistical guessing

Inference is possible because the parameters of naturally occurring populations are structured by data generating processes that are approximated by **probability distributions.** A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the probability of a random event. Today we will be focusing on height. [^1]

[^1]: The relationship of probability distributions and data-generating processes is complex, intriguing, and both historically and philosophically rich $\dots$. Because our interests are applied, we will hardly touch up this richness in this course, alas.

Today we will be talking about the "normal" or "Gaussian distribution." A very large number of data-generating processes in nature conform the normal distribution. 

Let's consider some examples of randomly generated samples, which we will obtain using R's `rnorm` function.


#### 100-person sample of heights

```{r}
set.seed(123)
sm<-rnorm(100, mean = 170, sd = 20)
ggplot2::qplot(sm, binwidth = 10)
```

#### 10-person sample of heights

```{r}
set.seed(123)
subsm <-rnorm(10, mean = 170, sd = 20)

ggplot2::qplot(
  subsm, binwidth = 10
  )
```

#### 10000-person sample of heights

```{r}
set.seed(123)
largesm <-rnorm(1e5, mean = 170, sd = 20)
ggplot2::qplot(
  largesm, binwidth = 1
  )
```

### How can I use regression to infer a population parameter?

We can use R to investigate the *average* height of our imaginary population from which the preceding samples were randomly drawn. We do this in R by writing an "intercept-only" model as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
model <- lm(outcome ~ 1, data = datset)
summary(model)
```

Using the previous simulations:

N = 10 random draws

```{r code_folding = FALSE}
#write the model and get a nice table for it
sjPlot::tab_model(
  lm(sm ~ 1)
)
```

N = 100 random draws

```{r  code_folding = FALSE}
sjPlot::tab_model(
  lm(subsm ~ 1)
)
```

N = 10,000 random draws

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(
  lm(largesm ~ 1)
)
```

What do we notice about the relationship between sample size the estimated population average?

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(
   lm(sm ~ 1),
   lm(subsm ~ 1),
   lm(largesm ~ 1)
)
```

### Regression with a single co-variate

Does mother height predict daughter height? It seems so. By what how close are is the relationship?

Francis Galton is credited with inventing regression. Galton observed that the height of offspring tends to fall between parental height and the population average, what Galton termed: "regression to the mean." Galton sought a method for educated guessing about heights, and this led to fitting a line of regression by a method called "least squares" (For a history see: [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2011.00509.x)).

This following dataset is from "The heredity of height", Karl Pearson and Alice Lee (1903)[@pearson1903]. I obtained the dataset from [@gelman2020]. Let's use this dataset to investigate the relationship between a mother's height and a daughter's height. 

```{r}
md_df <- data.frame(read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples/master/PearsonLee/data/MotherDaughterHeights.txt"), header=TRUE))
# Center mother's height for later example
md_df <- md_df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(mother_height_c = as.numeric(scale(mother_height, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)))
dplyr::glimpse(md_df)

```

Pearson and Lee collected 5,524 observations from mother/daughter height pairs. Let's examine the data, first by plotting the relationship.

What what is happening here?

```{r}
explore_md <-ggplot2::ggplot(data = md_df, aes(y = daughter_height, x = mother_height)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title = "The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") +
       ylab("Daughter's height") +
       xlab("Mother's height") + theme_classic()
explore_md
```

Is there a linear predictive relationship between these two parameters? In regression we examine the line of best fit.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(daughter_height ~ mother_height, data = md_df)
sjPlot::tab_model(m1)
```

We can plot the coefficient; in a model with one predictor isn't too informative. As we continue in the course, however, we'll see that plotting coefficients can be easier than deciphering the numbers in tables. Here are two methods for plotting.

```{r echo = FALSE, layout = "l-body-outset", fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
t_m1<-parameters::model_parameters(m1,  
                                   ci = 0.95)
method1 <- plot(t_m1) +
  labs(title = "The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") + 
  ylab("Daughter's height") 

method2 <-sjPlot::plot_model(m1)

library(patchwork)
method1 / method2 + plot_annotation(title = "Comparision of two coefficeint plots",
                                    subtitle = "a: parameters see; b: sjPlot", 
                                    tag_levels = "a")
```

## How do we interpret the regression model?

Let's write the equation out in mathematics. How do we read this? [^2]

[^2]: Later, we'll prefer a different way of writing regression equations in math. (Note: writing math isn't math - it's just encoding the model that we've written).

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("equatiomatic")
extract_eq(m1,  use_coefs = FALSE)
```

The math says that the expected daughter's height in a population is predicted by the average height of the population when mother's height is set to zero units (note, this is impossible - we'll come back to this) plus $\beta ~\times$ units of daughter's height (inches) for each additional unit of mother's height (inches) 

We can plug the output of the model directly into the equation as follows:

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("equatiomatic")
extract_eq(m1,  use_coefs = TRUE)
```

### Graph the relationship between mother's and daughter's heights

```{r code_folding = FALSE}
library(ggeffects)
toplot<-ggeffects::ggpredict(m1, terms = "mother_height")

heightplot<-plot(toplot, add.data = TRUE, dot.alpha = .1, jitter = TRUE) +   theme_classic()
heightplot + labs(title = "Predicted values of daughter's height from the Pearson/Fox 1903 dataset")

```

### Regression to predict beyond the range of a dataset

Joyte Amge is the world's shortest woman at 25 inches. Sandy Allen was the world's tallest woman at 91 inches. What is be the expected heights of their daughter, and of every intermediary woman in between?

```{r code_folding = FALSE}

# use the `expand.grid` command to create a sequence of points for mother's height
ndat<-expand.grid(mother_height = c(25:91)) 

# use the `predict` function to create a new response 
pr<- predict(m1, type = "response", interval = "confidence", newdata =ndat)

# have a look at the object
dplyr::glimpse(pr)

# create a new dataframe for the new sequence of points for mother's height and the predicted data
newdata<-data.frame(ndat,pr)
head(newdata)
```

Graph the predicted results

```{r  layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
# graph the expected results
predplot<-ggplot(data = newdata, 
       aes(x= mother_height, y = fit))  + 
  geom_point() +  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr), width = .1) + 
   expand_limits(x = c(20,91), y = c(0,81))  + theme_classic() + 
  labs(title = "Predicted values for a broader population")

# plot the two graphs together (making the x and y axis at the same scale )
library("patchwork")
# rescale heightplot

# old plot with the new axis and y axis scales, and remove points

heightplot2<-plot(toplot, add.data = FALSE) +   theme_classic()

nhp <- heightplot2 +  expand_limits(x = c(20,91), y = c(0,81) ) +  labs(title = "Predicted values of daughter's height from the Pearson/Fox 1903 dataset")

# double graph
 nhp /predplot  + plot_annotation(title = "What do you notie about these relationships?", tag_levels = "a")
```

A simple method for obtaining the predicted values form your fitted model is to obtain the ggeffects output without producing a graph.


```{r code_folding = FALSE}

library(ggeffects)
toplot<-ggeffects::ggpredict(m1, terms = "mother_height")
toplot
```

### Non-linear relationships

Linear regression assumes linearity conditional on a model. Often your data will not be linear!

Consider the following example:

```{r code_folding = FALSE}
# Simulate nonlinear relationship between x and y
b <- c(2, 0.75)
set.seed(12)
x <- rnorm(100)
set.seed(12)
y <- rnorm(100, mean = b[1] * exp(b[2] * x))
dat1 <- data.frame(x, y)

ot1 <-lm(y ~ x, data  = dat1)
# performance::check_model(ot1)

# Plot linear effect
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(ot1, terms = "x"), add.data =TRUE, dot.alpha = .4)
```

Non-linear relationship as modelled by a polynomial regression:

```{r  code_folding = FALSE}

library(splines)
ot2 <-lm(y ~ x + I(x^2), data  = dat1)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(ot2, terms = "x"), add.data =TRUE, dot.alpha = .4)
```

Here is another approach:

```{r  code_folding = FALSE}
library(splines)
ot2.b <-lm(y ~ x + poly(x, 2), data  = dat1)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(ot2.b, terms = "x"), add.data =TRUE, dot.alpha = .4)
```



Non-linear relationship as modeled by a general additive model (spline)

```{r code_folding = FALSE}
library(splines)

ot3 <-lm(y ~ bs(x), data  = dat1)

#performance::check_model(ot2)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(ot3, terms = "x"), add.data =TRUE, dot.alpha = .4)
```

### Centering

Any linear transformation of a predictor is OK. Often we center (or center and scale) all indicators, which gives us an intercept that is meaninful (the expected population average when the other indicators are set their average). 


```{r}
library(ggeffects)
# original model
m1 <- lm(daughter_height ~ mother_height, data = md_df)
mc <-lm(daughter_height ~ mother_height_c, data=md_df)
sjPlot::tab_model(m1,mc)
```

Graph model

```{r}
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(mc, terms = "mother_height_c"), add.data =TRUE, dot.alpha = .4)
```


Note: when fitting a polynomial or any interaction, it is important to center your indicators. We'll come back to this point in later lectures. 

### Model evaluation

A simple way to assess your model fit is to compare a model with one covariate with a simple intercept-only model and to assess improvement in either the `AIC` statistic or the `BIC` statistic. The `BIC` is similar to the `AIC` but adds a penalty for extra predictors.  An absolute improvement in either statistic of n > 10 is considered to be a better model. 

We can use the `performance` package to generate a table that compares fits.


```{r code_foldign = FALSE, code_folding =FALSE}
library(performance)
# intercept only
ionly <- lm(daughter_height ~ 1, data = md_df)

# covariate added
covadded <- lm(daughter_height ~ mother_height, data = md_df)

# evaluate
performance::compare_performance(ionly, covadded)
```

What was the model improvement? 

```{r}
# improved fit
BIC(ionly)- BIC(covadded)
```


### Generate a report

This is easy with the `report` package

For example: 
```{r code_folding = FALSE,}
report::report_statistics(covadded)
```

Or if you want a longer report
```{r code_folding = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
report::report(covadded)
```

Though use `statistically significant` in place of `significant`. This will avoid misleading your audience into thinking your result is important, when what you intend to communicate is that it is reliable. 




### Assumptions of regression

From Gelman and Hill [@gelman2006]

1.  Validity

2.  Linearity\*

3.  Independence of errors

4.  Equal variance of errors

  > unequal variance does not affect the most important aspect of a regression model, which is the   form of the predictors XB (p.46)

5.  Normality of errors (statistical independence)

  > The regression assumption that is generally least important is that the errors are normally   distributed. In fact, for the purpose of estimating the regression line (as compared to predicting individual data points), the assumption of normality is barely important at all. Thus, in contrast to many regression textbooks, we do not recommend diagnostics of the normality of re-gression residuals. [@gelman2006] p. 46

> A good way to diagnose violations of some of the assumptions just considered (importantly, linearity) is to plot the residuals  versus fitted values or simply individual predictors.[@gelman2006]

### Common confusions

#### Causal inference is tricky

People use the work "effect" but that is not what regression gives us (by default)

#### "Normality assumption"

As Gelman and Hill note, the "normality" assumption is the least important. And the assumption pertains to the normality of residuals

#### Statistical independence

This will be the main reason we do multi-level modelling: to condition on dependencies in the data.

#### Levels (wrong population)

We sample from undergraduates, but infer about the human population. 


## PART 2: Functions for simulation

### `rnorm`

`rnorm` is a R's random number generator. Within this function:

-   `n`specifies the number of observations
-   `sd` specifies the value of the standard deviation
-   `mean` specifies the value of the mean

```{r code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
# generate random numbers
ds <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
dplyr::glimpse(ds)
```

We can create a histogram:

```{r code_folding=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot2::qplot(ds) + labs(title = "1st random number list")
p1
```

We use shorthand for generating numbers:

```{r code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(54321)
ds_0 <- rnorm(1000)
dplyr::glimpse(ds_0)
```

Note that the first and the second graphs differ:

```{r layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
p2 <- ggplot2::qplot(ds_0) + labs(title = "2d random number list")
p1 + p2 + plot_annotation("The two graphs differ", tag_levels = 'i')
```

Or more formally we can ask R to test the equivalence:

```{r message=TRUE,  code_folding=FALSE}
identical(ds, ds_0)
```

Because we want to have reproducible code, we will use the `set.seed()` function in R to ensure the same random numbers are generated each time.

```{r warning=TRUE,  code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
t1 <-stats::rnorm(100)
set.seed(123)
t2 <-stats::rnorm(100)

# test
identical(t1, t2)
```

### `runif`

We use r uniform to generate continuous data within a point range

```{r}
set.seed(123)
ds1 <- runif(n =100, min = 0, max = 50)
dplyr::glimpse(ds1)
hist(ds1)
```

Say we want to simulate a range of values between two endpoints. This is useful for simulating explanatory variables.

`{r.  code_folding=FALSE} set.seed(123) exp <- runif(n =100, min = 130, max = 220) dplyr::glimpse(exp) hist(exp)`

### `rep`

Frequently we'll need to generate random factors. For this, R's `rep` function, `letters` function, and `LETTERS` function make happy friends.

Here's how these functions work

Lower case letters:

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
letters[1:3]
```

Upper case letters:

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
LETTERS[4:10]
```

Creating sequences using `each`

```{r code_folding=FALSE }
rep( letters[1:3], each = 3 )
```

Creating sequences using `times`

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}

rep( letters[1:3], times = 3 )

```

Create a sequences using `length.out`

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}

rep( letters[1:3], length.out = 5 )

```

Creating uneven sequences

```{r code_folding=FALSE }

rep( letters[1:3], times = c(3, 1, 4) )
```

combining `each` + `times`

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}

rep(letters[1:3], each = 2, times = 3)
```

`length.out`

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
rep(letters[1:3], each = 2, length.out = 17)
```

Note `length.out` take priority over `times` -- use `length.out` if you have a fixed vector length.

### `seq`

Create a vector of numbers of a specific length

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
seq(from = 1, to = 45, by = 1)
```

17 unit steps: 

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
seq(from = 1, to = 45, by = 17)
```

17 steps:

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
seq(from = 1, to = 45, length.out = 17)
```


### Flexible functions

We can use vectors within random number generation

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
vdf<-rnorm(n = 20, mean = c(0, 500, 1000, 10000), sd = c(5,50,100,1000))

# we created a vector 
dplyr::glimpse(vdf)
qplot(vdf, binwidth=4)
```


## Why Simulate?

## Simulate to assess result against noise

Recall the relationship between mother's heights and daughters heights in the Pearson/Fox dataset:

```{r}
# recall this model
explore_md <-ggplot2::ggplot(data = md_df, aes(y = daughter_height, x = mother_height)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title = "The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") +
       ylab("Daughter's height") +
       xlab("Mother's height") + theme_classic()
explore_md
```

What would a random relationship look like? Simulation can help us to address this question

```{r layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=10, code_folding = FALSE}
av_dh <-mean(md_df$daughter_height, na.rm=TRUE)
sd_dh <-sd(md_df$daughter_height, na.rm=TRUE)
av_mh <-mean(md_df$mother_height, na.rm=TRUE)
sd_mh <-sd(md_df$mother_height, na.rm=TRUE)

# number of obs
N<- nrow(md_df)

# fake data
sim_dh = rnorm(N, av_dh, sd_dh)
sim_mh = rnorm(N, av_mh, sd_mh)
sim_df_md <- data.frame(sim_dh,sim_mh)
fake_md <-ggplot2::ggplot(data = sim_df_md, aes(y = sim_dh, x = sim_mh)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title = "Fake data relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") +
       ylab("Daughter's height") +
       xlab("Mother's height") + theme_classic() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

# real data
explore_md <-ggplot2::ggplot(data = md_df, aes(y = daughter_height, x = mother_height)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title = "The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") +
       ylab("Daughter's height") +
       xlab("Mother's height") + theme_classic() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)


library(patchwork)
fake_md + explore_md  + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "a")

```


### Use fake data to explore a small sample

Can appear to reveal relationships that are not there.

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
# no relationship between x and y
x = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

df<-data.frame(x,y)
ggplot2::ggplot(df,aes(y,x)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

### Simulate a relationship between two variables

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
### Simulate a relationship between two variables 
library(ggplot2)
N = 1000
weight <-runif(N, min = 50, max =100)
b <- rlnorm(N,.78,.1)
b
sigma <- runif(N, 0 , 10 )
height = weight * b

height
# simulated height/ weight data
df<-data.frame(height,weight)

m0<-lm(height ~ weight, data = df)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(m0, terms = c("weight")), add.data = TRUE, dot.alpha = .8) + labs(x = "simulated weight",
                y = "simulated height",
                title = "simulated linear relationship")
```

Simulate a non-linear model

```{r}
a <-160
b <- c(2, 0.75)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100, mean = b[1] * exp(b[2] * x))
dat1 <- data.frame(x, y)
plot(y ~ x , data = dat1)

#Polynomial
N<-1000

### Use fake data to create a factor

Here we simulate no relationship between a group and an outcome

```{r}
N <- 200 # number of observations
#group <- rep((0:1), length.out = 200) # 2 groups
group <- rep(c("m","n_m"), each = N/2) #equivalent:
a <- rnorm(N, 150, 3) # intercept
b1 <- rnorm(N, 20, 1) # coefficient of "b
sigma = rexp(N,1)# error term
outcome <- rnorm(N, mean = a + b1 * (group == "m"), sigma)

df <-data.frame(outcome,group)
dplyr::glimpse(df)


#model removing the intercept to show the difference
ms<-lm(outcome ~ -1 + group, data = df)
ms
# no difference
sjPlot::plot_model(ms)

```

### Is imbalance in my study causing a problem?

```{r}
### Is imbalance wrecking my inference? 

N <- 120
cells <-rep( letters[1:2], times = c(15, 105))

a <- rnorm(N, 2, 1)
b1 <- rnorm(N, .2, .1)
sigma <- rexp(N,1)

out <- rnorm(N, mean = a + b1 * (cells == "b"), sigma)
dfc<-data.frame(out,cells)
sim_cells<-lm(out ~ cells, data = dfc)

summary(sim_cells)
```

This isn't too convincing: we need to replicate the model many times

```{r}
# Make a function for the simulation
set.seed(12)
test_fun = function() {
  N <- 120
  cells <-rep( letters[1:2], times = c(110, 10))
  a <- rnorm(N, 2, 1)
  b1 <- rnorm(N, 1, .1)
  sigma <- rexp(N, 1)
  out <- rnorm(N, mean = a + b1 * (cells == "b"), sigma)
  dfc <- data.frame(out, cells)
  sim_cells <- lm(out ~ cells, data = dfc)
  sim_cells
}

sim_lm = replicate(20, test_fun(), simplify = FALSE )
length(sim_lm)
```

We can use the `purrr` package to generate many replicates of a model

```{r}
library(dplyr)
tab_sim<-purrr::map_dfr(sim_lm, broom::tidy)
tab_sim %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 5)
```

What percentage of simulations yield "significant results?

```{r}
sum(tab_sim$p.value <= .05) / length(tab_sim$p.value)
```

Does balance fix the issue?

```{r}
# Make a function for the simulation
set.seed(12)
test_fun = function() {
  N <- 120
  cells <-rep( letters[1:2], times = c(60, 60))
  a <- rnorm(N, 2, 1)
  b1 <- rnorm(N, 1, .1)
  sigma <- rexp(N, 1)
  out <- rnorm(N, mean = a + b1 * (cells == "b"), sigma)
  dfc <- data.frame(out, cells)
  sim_cells <- lm(out ~ cells, data = dfc)
  sim_cells
}

sim_lm = replicate(20, test_fun(), simplify = FALSE )
length(sim_lm)

```

We can use the `purrr` package to generate many replicates of a model

```{r}
library(dplyr)
tab_sim<-purrr::map_dfr(sim_lm, broom::tidy)
tab_sim %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 5)
```

What percentage of simulations yield "significant results?

```{r}
sum(tab_sim$p.value <= .05) / length(tab_sim$p.value)
```

## Appendix 1: Conceptual Background

Some preliminaries about science.

### Science begins with a question

Science begins with a question about the world. The first step in science, then, is to clarify what you want to know.

Because science is a social practice, you will also need to clarify why your question is interesting: so what?

In short, know your question.

### Scientific model (or theory)

Sometimes scientists are interested in specific features of the world: how did virus x originate? Such a question might have a forensic interest: what constellation of events gave rise to a novel infectious disease?

More typically, scientists seek generalisations. How do infectious diseases evolve? How do biological organisms evolve? Such questions have applied and fundamental interests. How can we better prevent infectious disease? How did life originate?

A scientific model is a proposal for how nature is structured (and unstructured). For example, the theory of evolution by natural selection proposes that life emerges from variation, inheritance, and differential reproduction/survival.

To evaluate a scientific model, scientists must make generalisations beyond individual cases. This is where statistics shines.

### What is statistics?

Mathematics is a logic of certainty.

Statistics is a logic of uncertainty.

A statistical model uses the logic of probability to make better guesses.

### Applications of statistical models in science

Scientific models seek to explain how nature is structured. Where scientific models conflict, we can combine statistical models with data-collection to evaluate the credibility of of one theoretical model over others. To do this, a scientific model must make distinct, non-trivial predictions about the world.

If the predictions are not distinct, the observations will not enable a shift in credibility for one theory over another. Consider the theory that predicts any observation. Such a theory would be better classified as a conspiracy theory; it is compatible with any evidence whatsoever.

<!-- Sometimes the processes of empirical testing is called "hypothesis testing." In the weeks ahead, we will distinguish the intellectually excellent concept of "hypothesis testing" from "Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)." Although there is is nothing inherently flawed with NHST, it's misunderstandings have been an abomination. -->

Today we introduce a statistical method called regression. We will focus on how regression helps both to evaluate, and to make, informed predictions about the structures of the world.

## Appendix 2: How your computer sees your data

### Under the hood

Under the hood, your computer sees your data as consisting of vectors and matrices. An algorithm searches to estimate (or in the case of Bayesian inference, to "solve") an optimization problem to obtain a location for the unobserved parameter; in the case we examined above, this parameter is the relationship between daughter heights and mother heights.

$$\begin{bmatrix}
\textbf{y}\\
\textit{daughter's height}\\
51.5\\
52.5 \\
53.0 \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\textbf{intercept} \\
1 \\
1 \\
1 \\
1 \\
\vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\textbf{x}\\
\textit{mother's height}\\
59.5\\
57.5 \\
60.0 \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\textbf{b}\\
29.8 \\
0.54
\end{bmatrix}$$
