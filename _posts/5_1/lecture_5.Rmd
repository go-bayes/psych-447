## Overview

In Part 1 we will introduce regression.

In Part 2 we will:

-   learn how to use R to generate random numbers
-   use random numbers to simulate data

## Learning outcomes

By learning regression, you will better equipped to do psychological science and to evaluate psychological research.

By *beginning* to learn how to simulate data you will better understand how what a regression model is doing, to evaluate your regression model, and to plan research. Note, that we will not expect you to simulate a dataset just yet. Instead, we will illustrate the use of tools for simulation, and ask that you try out very basic simulation functions. It will not be until after the April break that you will simulate any data for the purposes of assisting in statistical inference.  


## What is regression?

Broadly speaking, a regression model is method for inferring the expected average features of a population, and the variance of a population, conditional on other features of the a population as embodied in measurements obtained from a sample.

We'll see that regression encompasses more than this definition, however, the definition makes a start.

To understand regression we need to understand the following jargon words: population, sample, measurement, and inference.


#### What is a population? 

In science, a population is a hypothetical construct. It is the set of all potential members of a set of things. In psychological science that set is typically a collection of individuals. We want to understand "The population of all human beings?" or  "The New Zealand adult population"; or "The population of undergraduates who may be recruited for IPRP in New Zealand." 

### Sample

A sample is a radomly realised sub-population from the larger abstract population that a scientific community hopes to generalise about. Think of selecting balls randomly from an urn.  If selected randomly, the balls may inform us about the contents of the urn. For example, if we select one white ball and one black ball, we may know that the balls in the urn are not all black. (Consider why randomness might be important.)

#### Measurement

A measure is tool or method for obtaining numerical descriptions of a sample. We often call measures "scales."  We can think of a bathroom weight scale as a tool and method for tracking body weight.

In the course, we have encountered numerical scales, ordinal scales, and factors. The topic of measurement in psychological is, to say the least, very broad. 

For now, it is important to keep in mind that similar to bathroom scales, measures can be prone to error. Also similar to bathroom scales, error prone scales may nevertheless be useful for specific interests and purposes.   


#### Parameter

In regression, we call the feature of interest in the population a "parameter." In regression, we combine measurements on samples with probability theory to guess about the properties of a population we will never observe. 

#### Statistical inference 

Is is the guessing about parameters that constitutes the bulk of statistical inference. 

#### Probability distributions and statistical guessing

Inference is possible because the parameters of a population are structured by data generating processes that are approximated by probability distributions. 

The relationship of probability distributions and data-generating processes is complex, intriguing, and both historically and philosophically rich $\dots$. Because our interests are applied, we will hardly touch up this richness. 

Today we will be talking about the "normal" or "Gaussian distribution." A very large number of data-generating processes in nature conform the the normal


Let's consider some examples of randomly generated samples, which we will obtain using R's `rnorm` function.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
sm<-rnorm(100, mean = 170, sd = 20)
ggplot2::qplot(sm, binwidth = 10)
```

Small sample

```{r}
set.seed(123)
subsm <-rnorm(10, mean = 170, sd = 20)

ggplot2::qplot(
  subsm, binwidth = 10
  )
```

Large sample

```{r}
set.seed(123)
largesm <-rnorm(1e5, mean = 170, sd = 20)
ggplot2::qplot(
  largesm, binwidth = 1
  )
```

### Predictive inference (forcasting)

What is the the expected average for the population from which the sample is drawn?

### Tables of regression coefficients

N = 100

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(
  lm(sm ~ 1)
)
```

N = 10

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(
  lm(subsm ~ 1)
)
```

N = 10,000

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(
  lm(largesm ~ 1)
)
```

What do we notice about the relationship betwen sample size the estimated population average?

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(
   lm(sm ~ 1),
   lm(subsm ~ 1),
   lm(largesm ~ 1)
)
```

## Why regression?

People use when they are interested in understanding and variance of

## Regression examples: daughters/mothers heights.

This data set is from "The heredity of height", Karl Pearson and Alice Lee (1903)[@pearson1903]

```{r}
md_df <- data.frame(read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples/master/PearsonLee/data/MotherDaughterHeights.txt"), header=TRUE))
dplyr::glimpse(md_df)
```

Does mother height predict daughter height? It seems so. By what how close are is the relationship?

Pearson and Lee collected 5,524 data points from mother's and daughters. Let's examine the data, first by plotting the relationship.

What what is happening here?

```{r}
explore_md <-ggplot2::ggplot(data = md_df, aes(y = daughter_height, x = mother_height)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title = "The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") +
       ylab("Daughter's height") +
       xlab("Mother's height") + theme_classic()
explore_md
```

Is there a linear predictive relationship between these two parameters? In regression we examine the line of best fit.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(daughter_height ~ mother_height, data = md_df)
sjPlot::tab_model(m1)
```

We can plot the coefficient, which in a model with one predictor isn't too informative.

```{r echo = FALSE}
t_m1<-parameters::model_parameters(m1,  
                                   ci = 0.95)
plot(t_m1) +
  labs(title = "The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") + 
  ylab("Daughter's height") 
```

## How do we interpret the regression model?

Let's write the equation out in mathematics. How do we read this? [^1]

[^1]: Later, we'll prefer a different way of writing regression equations in math. (Note: writing math isn't math - it's just encoding the model that we've written).

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("equatiomatic")
extract_eq(m1,  use_coefs = FALSE)
```

The math says that the expected daughter's height in a population is predicted by the average height of the population when mother's height is set to zero units (note, this is impossible - we'll come back to this) plus .$$\beta ~\times $$ units of daughter's height (inches) for each additional unit of mother's height (inches) + some

We can plug the output of the model directly into the equation as follows:

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("equatiomatic")
extract_eq(m1,  use_coefs = TRUE)
```

### Predicted daughter heights from mother heights

```{r}
library(ggeffects)
toplot<-ggeffects::ggpredict(m1, terms = "mother_height")
toplot
```

### Under the hood

```{r}
heightplot<-plot(toplot, add.data = TRUE, dot.alpha = .1, jitter = TRUE) +   theme_classic()
heightplot + labs(title = "Predicted values of daughter's height from the Pearson/Fox 1903 dataset")

```

### Regression to predict?

Joyte Amge is the world's shortest woman at 25 inches. Sandy Allen was the world's tallest woman at 91 inches. What is be the expected heights of their daughter, and of every intermediary woman in between?

```{r}
# use the `expand.grid` command to create a sequence of points for mother's height
ndat<-expand.grid(mother_height = c(25:91)) 

# use the `predict` function to create a new response 
pr<- predict(m1, type = "response", interval = "confidence", newdata =ndat)

# have a look at the object
dplyr::glimpse(pr)

# create a new dataframe for the new sequence of points for mother's height and the predicted data
newdata<-data.frame(ndat,pr)
head(newdata)
```

Graph the predicted results

```{r  layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
# graph the expected results
predplot<-ggplot(data = newdata, 
       aes(x= mother_height, y = fit))  + 
  geom_point() +  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr), width = .1) + 
   expand_limits(x = c(20,91), y = c(0,81))  + theme_classic() + 
  labs(title = "Predicted values for a broader population")

# plot the two graphs together (making the x and y axis at the same scale )
library("patchwork")
# rescale heightplot

# old plot with the new axis and y axis scales, and remove points

heightplot2<-plot(toplot, add.data = FALSE) +   theme_classic()

nhp <- heightplot2 +  expand_limits(x = c(20,91), y = c(0,81) ) +  labs(title = "Predicted values of daughter's height from the Pearson/Fox 1903 dataset")

# double graph
 nhp /predplot  + plot_annotation(title = "What do you notie about these relationships?", tag_levels = "a")
```

### Under the hood

$$\begin{bmatrix}
\textbf{y}\\
\textit{daughter's height}\\
51.5\\
52.5 \\
53.0 \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}

\end{bmatrix}$$

### Non-linear relationships

```{r}
# Simulate nonlinear relationshp between x and y
b <- c(2, 0.75)
set.seed(12)
x <- rnorm(100)
set.seed(12)
y <- rnorm(100, mean = b[1] * exp(b[2] * x))
dat1 <- data.frame(x, y)

ot1 <-lm(y ~ x, data  = dat1)
# performance::check_model(ot1)

# Plot linear effect
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(ot1, terms = "x"), add.data =TRUE, dot.alpha = .4)
```

Non-linear effect

```{r}
library(splines)
ot2 <-lm(y ~ x + I(x^2), data  = dat1)
#performance::check_model(ot2)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(ot2, terms = "x"), add.data =TRUE, dot.alpha = .4)
```

Splines

```{r}
library(splines)
ot3 <-lm(y ~ bs(x), data  = dat1)
#performance::check_model(ot2)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(ot3, terms = "x"), add.data =TRUE, dot.alpha = .4)
```

#### Model evaluation

```{r}
# simulate heights
# simulate weights
set.seed(123)

weight_sim = runif(n = 100, min = 40, max = 100)

a <- 60

b <- rnorm(n=100, 1.4,.1)

mu <- a + weight_sim * b + rnorm(100,0,10)

height_sim = rnorm(100,mu,10)

df <-data.frame(height_sim, weight_sim)

```

Explore data

```{r}

ggplot(data = df,

       aes(y = height_sim, x = weight_sim)

       ) +

  geom_point() +

  geom_smooth(method = lm)

```

### Assumptions of regression

From Gelman and Hill [@gelman2006]

1.  validity
2.  addititivity/linearity
3.  independence of errors
4.  equal variance of errors \> unequal variance does not affect the most important aspect of a regression model, which is the form of the predictors XB (p.46)
5.  normality of errors \> The regression assumption that is generally least important is that the errors are normally distributed. In fact, for the purpose of estimating the regression line (as compared to predicting individual data points), the assumption of normality is barely important at all. Thus, in contrast to many regression textbooks, we do not recommend diagnostics of the normality of re- gression residuals. p. 46 \> A good way to diagnose violations of some of the assumptions just considered (importantly, linearity) is to plot the residuals ri versus fitted values or simply individual predictors.

### Common confusions

#### Causal inference is tricky

People use the work "effect" but that is not what regression gives us (by default)

#### "Normality assumption"

#### Statistical independence

#### Levels (wrong population)

## Functions for simulation

### `rnorm`

`rnorm` is a r's random number generator. Within this function:

-   `n`specifies the number of observations
-   `sd` specifies the value of the standard deviation
-   `mean` specifies the value of the mean

```{r code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
# generate random numbers
ds <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
dplyr::glimpse(ds)
```

We can create a histogram:

```{r code_folding=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot2::qplot(ds) + labs(title = "1st random number list")
p1
```

We use shorthand for generating numbers:

```{r code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(54321)
ds_0 <- rnorm(1000)
dplyr::glimpse(ds_0)
```

Note that the first and the second graphs differ:

```{r layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
p2 <- ggplot2::qplot(ds_0) + labs(title = "2d random number list")
p1 + p2 + plot_annotation("The two graphs differ", tag_levels = 'i')
```

Or more formally we can ask R to test the equivalence:

```{r message=TRUE,  code_folding=FALSE}
identical(ds, ds_0)
```

Because we want to have reproducible code, we will use the `set.seed()` function in R to ensure the same random numbers are generated each time.

```{r warning=TRUE,  code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
t1 <-stats::rnorm(100)
set.seed(123)
t2 <-stats::rnorm(100)

# test
identical(t1, t2)
```

### `runif`

We use r uniform to generate continuous data within a point range

```{r}
set.seed(123)
ds1 <- runif(n =100, min = 0, max = 50)
dplyr::glimpse(ds1)
hist(ds1)
```

Say we want to simulate a range of values between two endpoints. This is useful for simulating explanatory variables.

`{r.  code_folding=FALSE} set.seed(123) exp <- runif(n =100, min = 130, max = 220) dplyr::glimpse(exp) hist(exp)`

### `rep`

Frequently we'll need to generate random factors. For this, R's `rep` function, `letters` function, and `LETTERS` function make happy friends.

Here's how these functions work

Lower case letters:

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
letters[1:3]
```

Upper case letters:

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
LETTERS[4:10]
```

Creating sequences using `each`

```{r code_folding=FALSE }
rep( letters[1:3], each = 3 )
```

Creating sequences using `times`

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}

rep( letters[1:3], times = 3 )

```

Create a sequences using `length.out`

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}

rep( letters[1:3], length.out = 5 )

```

Creating uneven sequences

```{r code_folding=FALSE }

rep( letters[1:3], times = c(3, 1, 4) )
```

combining `each` + `times`

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}

rep(letters[1:3], each = 2, times = 3)
```

`length.out`

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
rep(letters[1:3], each = 2, length.out = 17)
```

Note `length.out` take priority over `times` -- use `length.out` if you have a fixed vector length.

### `seq`

## Simulation

## Simulate to assess result against noise

Recall the relationship between mother's heights and daughters heights in the Pearson/Fox dataset:

```{r}
# recall this model
explore_md <-ggplot2::ggplot(data = md_df, aes(y = daughter_height, x = mother_height)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title = "The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") +
       ylab("Daughter's height") +
       xlab("Mother's height") + theme_classic()
explore_md
```

What would a random relationship look like?

```{r layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
av_dh <-mean(md_df$daughter_height, na.rm=TRUE)
sd_dh <-sd(md_df$daughter_height, na.rm=TRUE)
av_mh <-mean(md_df$mother_height, na.rm=TRUE)
sd_mh <-sd(md_df$mother_height, na.rm=TRUE)

# number of obs
N<- nrow(md_df)

# fake data
sim_dh = rnorm(N, av_dh, sd_dh)
sim_mh = rnorm(N, av_mh, sd_mh)
sim_df_md <- data.frame(sim_dh,sim_mh)
fake_md <-ggplot2::ggplot(data = sim_df_md, aes(y = sim_dh, x = sim_mh)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title = "Fake data relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") +
       ylab("Daughter's height") +
       xlab("Mother's height") + theme_classic() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

# real data
explore_md <-ggplot2::ggplot(data = md_df, aes(y = daughter_height, x = mother_height)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title = "The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height") +
       ylab("Daughter's height") +
       xlab("Mother's height") + theme_classic() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)


library(patchwork)
fake_md + explore_md  + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "a")

```

We can build a model using fake data

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
height_sim = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 170, sd = 40)
weight_sim = runif(n = 100, min = 40, max = 100)
```

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
m0 <- lm(height_sim ~ weight_sim)
summary(m0)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(m0, terms = c("weight_sim")), add.data = TRUE, dot.alpha = .1)

```

We can use vectors within random number generation

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
vdf<-rnorm(n = 20, mean = c(0, 500, 1000), sd = c(5,50,100))
qplot(vdf, binwidth=4)
```

# Use fake data to explore a small sample

Can appear to reveal relationships that are not there.

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
# no relationship between x and y
x = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

df<-data.frame(x,y)
ggplot2::ggplot(df,aes(y,x)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

Simulate the relationship between two variables

```{r  code_folding=FALSE}
### Simulate a relationship between two variables 
library(ggplot2)
N = 1000
weight <-runif(N, min = 50, max =100)
b <- rlnorm(N,.78,.1)
b
sigma <- runif(N, 0 , 10 )
height = weight * b

height
# simulated height/ weight data
df<-data.frame(height,weight)

m0<-lm(height ~ weight, data = df)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(m0, terms = c("weight")), add.data = TRUE, dot.alpha = .8) + labs(x = "simulated weight",
                y = "simulated height",
                title = "simulated linear relationship")
```

Simulate a non-linear model

```{r}
a <-160
b <- c(2, 0.75)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100, mean = b[1] * exp(b[2] * x))
dat1 <- data.frame(x, y)
plot(y ~ x , data = dat1)

#Polynomial
N<-1000

# simulate weights
weight <-runif(N, min = 60, max =120)
weight_c <-scale(weight, scale=FALSE)

# simulate coefficients

a = rnorm(N, mean = 180 , 10 )
b1 = rnorm(N, mean = 2.2, .01)
b2 = - rnorm(N, mean = .02, .001)

height <- a + b1 * weight_c  +  b2 * weight_c^2

# simulated height/ weight data

df1<-data.frame(height,weight_c, weight)

plot(height ~ weight)

m1 <- lm(height ~ weight_c, data = df1)
plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(m1, terms = c("weight_c")),
     add.data = TRUE,
     dot.alpha = .2)  + labs(title = "simulated linear relationship") +
  xlab("simulated weight") +  ylab("simulated height")



```

Non-linear model

```{r}
m2 <-lm(height ~ weight_c + I(weight_c^2), data = df1)

plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(m2, terms = c("weight_c")),
     add.data = TRUE,
     dot.alpha = .2) + labs( title = "simulated linear relationship") + 
  xlab("simulated weight") +  ylab("simulated height")

m3 <-lm(height ~ bs(weight_c), data = df1)

summary(m3)

plot(ggeffects::ggpredict(m3, terms = c("weight_c")),
     add.data = TRUE,
     dot.alpha = .2)  + labs( title = "simulated linear relationship") + 
  xlab("simulated weight") +  ylab("simulated height")


```

Check linear model

```{r}
performance::check_model(m1)
```

Check quadradic model

```{r}
performance::check_model(m2)
```

Check splines model

```{r}
performance::check_model(m3)
```

## Use fake data to create a factor

Here we simulate no relationship between a group and an outcome

```{r}
N <- 200 # number of observations
#group <- rep((0:1), length.out = 200) # 2 groups
group <- rep(c("m","n_m"), each = N/2) #equivalent:
a <- rnorm(N, 150, 3) # intercept
b1 <- rnorm(N, 20, 1) # coefficient of "b
sigma = rexp(N,1)# error term
outcome <- rnorm(N, mean = a + b1 * (group == "m"), sigma)

df <-data.frame(outcome,group)
dplyr::glimpse(df)


#model removing the intercept to show the difference
ms<-lm(outcome ~ -1 + group, data = df)
ms
# no difference
sjPlot::plot_model(ms)

```

Is imbalance in my study causing a problem?

```{r}
### Is imbalance wrecking my inference? 

N <- 120
cells <-rep( letters[1:2], times = c(15, 105))

a <- rnorm(N, 2, 1)
b1 <- rnorm(N, .2, .1)
sigma <- rexp(N,1)

out <- rnorm(N, mean = a + b1 * (cells == "b"), sigma)
dfc<-data.frame(out,cells)
sim_cells<-lm(out ~ cells, data = dfc)

summary(sim_cells)
```

This isn't too convincing: we need to replicate the model many times

```{r}
# Make a function for the simulation
set.seed(12)
test_fun = function() {
  N <- 120
  cells <-rep( letters[1:2], times = c(110, 10))
  a <- rnorm(N, 2, 1)
  b1 <- rnorm(N, 1, .1)
  sigma <- rexp(N, 1)
  out <- rnorm(N, mean = a + b1 * (cells == "b"), sigma)
  dfc <- data.frame(out, cells)
  sim_cells <- lm(out ~ cells, data = dfc)
  sim_cells
}

sim_lm = replicate(20, test_fun(), simplify = FALSE )
length(sim_lm)
```

We can use the `purrr` package to generate many replicates of a model

```{r}
library(dplyr)
tab_sim<-purrr::map_dfr(sim_lm, broom::tidy)
tab_sim %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 5)
```

What percentage of simulations yeild "significant results?

```{r}
sum(tab_sim$p.value <= .05) / length(tab_sim$p.value)
```

Does balance fix the issue?

```{r}
# Make a function for the simulation
set.seed(12)
test_fun = function() {
  N <- 120
  cells <-rep( letters[1:2], times = c(60, 60))
  a <- rnorm(N, 2, 1)
  b1 <- rnorm(N, 1, .1)
  sigma <- rexp(N, 1)
  out <- rnorm(N, mean = a + b1 * (cells == "b"), sigma)
  dfc <- data.frame(out, cells)
  sim_cells <- lm(out ~ cells, data = dfc)
  sim_cells
}

sim_lm = replicate(20, test_fun(), simplify = FALSE )
length(sim_lm)

## Random number generation

#### `rnorm` function

```{r code_folding = FALSE}
rnorm(n=20, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

-   n = number of observations
-   sd = vector of standard deviations
-   mean = vector of means

## Appendix 1:  Conceptual Background

Some preliminaries about science.

### Science begins with a question

Science begins with a question about the world. The first step in science, then, is to clarify what you want to know.

Because science is a social practice, you will also need to clarify why your question is interesting: so what?

In short, know your question.

### Scientific model (or theory)

Sometimes scientists are interested in specific features of the world: how did virus x originate? Such a question might have a forensic interest: what constellation of events gave rise to a novel infectious disease?

More typically, scientists seek generalisations. How do infectious diseases evolve? How do biological organisms evolve? Such questions have applied and fundamental interests. How can we better prevent infectious disease? How did life originate?

A scientific model is a proposal for how nature is structured (and unstructured). For example, the theory of evolution by natural selection proposes that life emerges from variation, inheritance, and differential reproduction/survival.

To evaluate a scientific model, scientists must make generalisations beyond individual cases. This is where statistics shines.

### What is statistics?

Mathematics is a logic of certainty.

Statistics is a logic of uncertainty.

A statistical model uses the logic of probability to make better guesses.

### Applications of statistical models in science

Scientific models seek to explain how nature is structured. Where scientific models conflict, we can combine statistical models with data-collection to evaluate the credibility of of one theoretical model over others. To do this, a scientific model must make distinct, non-trivial predictions about the world.

If the predictions are not distinct, the observations will not enable a shift in credibility for one theory over another. Consider the theory that predicts any observation. Such a theory would be better classified as a conspiracy theory; it is compatible with any evidence whatsoever.

<!-- Sometimes the processes of empirical testing is called "hypothesis testing." In the weeks ahead, we will distinguish the intellectually excellent concept of "hypothesis testing" from "Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)." Although there is is nothing inherently flawed with NHST, it's misunderstandings have been an abomination. -->

Today we introduce a statistical method called regression. We will focus on how regression helps both to evaluate, and to make, informed predictions about the structures of the world.
