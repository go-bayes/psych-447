## Objectives

-   To clarify the concepts of causal inference and causal confounding
-   To use these concepts, in combination with the `ggdag` package, to develop a workflow for causal inference that mitigates the risks of causal confounding. <!-- - To introduce tools for multiple-imputation, which addresses missing data problems that may lead to causal confounding.  -->

## What is causal inference?

Up to this point in the course, we have been using regression for prediction, asking:

> What is the expected change in y conditional on different levels of x?

When there are two or more predictors

> What is the expected change in y conditional on different levels of x1 and x2, and what additional information do we learn from x1 given x2 (and x2, given x1).

Prediction is possible when there are regularities in the world that make y more predictable when we have information about x1 (x2, x3 ...).

Prediction is useful for many practical questions:

-   "Which candidate is more likely to win the election?"
-   "Are people getting happier as they get older?"
-   "Does having meaning and purpose in life predict lower psychological distress.

However, for the most part, scientists seek *causal* explanations. The topic of causation is tricky. We will think about causation by thinking about the effects of interventions. What would happen to y if we were to change x1 (or x2)?  For example:

Most theories in psychological science are causal explanations: they make claims about how people think and why they act. 

  - Why did those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 switch party vote for Donald Trump in 2016?  

Political psychology differs from polling because political psychology seeks to clarify the operations of the psychological, social, economic, and behavioral mechanisms that underpin voting behaviour, among other questions. To posit that inequality caused change is to imply that if inequality had been different voting behaviour would have been different. Sometimes we can use regression to test such predictions. However, often we can't. Whether we can or cannot is rarely transparent.  Although regression can be useful as a tool for evaluating causal theories, it is a dangerous tool. Think of today's lecture as a health and saftey induction (so to speak). We will clarify how to use regression as a tool for causal inference while alerting you to common hazards. We will begin on familiar ground.

## Omitted variable bias

Often when researchers include additional co-variates into their regression into their regression model they are worried about confounding from omitted variable bias. They use the word "control" to indicate that they are addressing this hazard.  The case is familiar.  X and Y are uncorrelated. However a lurking third variable is responsible for their apparent correlation. 


```{r}
library(ggdag)
theme_set(theme_dag())

# create confounded triangle
d1 <- confounder_triangle() %>%
  ggdag_dconnected()

d1
```

We can simulate date that have this causal relationship and ask what would happen were we to regress X on Y without accounting for Z. 

```{r}
set.seed(123)
N <- 100
z <- rnorm(N)# sim z
x <- rnorm(N , -z) # sim z -> x
y <- rnorm(N , z) # sim z -> y
df <- data.frame(x, z, y)

# note there is a predictive relationship between X to Y
plot(x, y)
```

Regressing X on Y: 

```{r}
m0 <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)
parameters::model_parameters(m0)
```

X and Y are correlated. If we know X we can better predict Y. However our ability to predict arises from a process outside of X and Y. Put metaphorically,  X "listens to" Z and Y "listens to" Z because Z influences both X and Y. If Z were to change, then so too would X and so too would Y. However X does not cause Y. If we were to intervene in the world and change X this would not change Y. Put yet another way, once we know Z, we do not gain any additional information about Y from X. 

To understand the implications of information flow with in a regression model we will use directed acylical graphs or DAGS

## Directed Acyclical Graphs 

A directed acyclical graph (DAGS) is heuristic tools for investigating causal inference in a regression model. A DAG is a graph that has nodes and edges. The edges point in the direction of a causal influence. The flows are "acyclical" because a cause is not at the same time an effect. The `ggdag` package is useful for identifying potential confounding in your dataset and we will rely heavily on that package today.

**Warning: assessing causal inference using a DAG typically requires assumptions that are *not* part of your dataset. A poorly specified DAG will lead to poor inference. There is _no_ working around this!**


#### Aside 

In the causal inference literature, we evaluate dependencies using the langauge of "conditional independence."  

Once we condition on Z, the link between X and Y is broken.


```{r}
# we can use the language of conditional independence
g <- dagitty( "dag{ x <- z -> y }" )
impliedConditionalIndependencies( g )
```

We can use implied conditional independencies to test whether our DAG is right. For example, if X were to remain reliably predictive of Y, then we would know that the DAG we have drawn here is not correct. 

#### Resume


Many applied scientists equate omitted variable bias with confounding.  For this reason, they seek to "control" for every variable that might be associated with both X and Y.  If the relationship between X and Y holds after including such "controls," many applied scientist will infer that there is a causal relationship between X and Y.  We will see that this is not the case; quite the opposite, controlling for many variables is an invitation to confounding, leading to erroneous causal inference.  Do not adopt a "causal salad" approach to regression.

> “But the approach which dominates in many parts of biology and the social sciences is instead CAUSAL SALAD.36 Causal salad means tossing various “control” variables into a statistical model, observing changes in estimates, and then telling a story about causation. Causal salad seems founded on the notion that only omitted variables can mislead us about causation. But included variables can just as easily confound us. When tossing a causal salad, a model that makes good predictions may still mislead about causation. If we use the model to plan an intervention, it will get everything wrong. Richard McElreath “Statistical Rethinking" Chapter 1, p46.


### Omitted variable DAG

Let's use `ggdag` to identify confounding arising from omitting Z in our regression of X on Y.

First we write out the DAG as follows:

```{r}
# code for creating a DAG
ggdag_ov <- dagify(y ~ z,
                       x ~ z,
                       exposure = "x",
                       outcome = "y") %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout = "tree")

# plot the DAG
ggdag_ov %>%
  ggdag()
```

Next we ask `ggdag` which variables we need to include if we are to obtain an unbiased estimate of the outcome from the exposure:

```{r}
# use this code

ggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set( ggdag_ov )

```

The graph tells us to obtain an unbiased estimate of Y on X we must condition on Z.

And indeed, when we included the omitted variable Z in our simulated dateset it breaks the association between X and Y:

```{r}
m1 <- lm(y ~ x + z, data = df)

parameters::model_parameters(m1)
```




## Mediation and causation

Suppose we were interested in the causal effect of X on Y.  We have a direct effect of X on Y as well as an indirect effect of X on Y through M. We use `ggdag` to draw the DAG:


```{r}
dag_1 <- dagify(y ~ x + m,
                m ~ x,
                exposure = "x",
                outcome = "y") %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout = "tree")

dag_1 %>%
  ggdag()
```

What should we condition on if we are interested in the causal effect of changes in X on changes in Y?

We can pose the question to `ggdag`:

```{r}
# ask ggdag which variables to condition on:

ggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set(dag_1)

```

'Backdoor Paths Unconditionally Closed' means that, assuming the DAG we have drawn is correct, we may obtain an unbiased estimate of X on Y without including additional variables. 

Later we shall understand why this is the case.^[We shall see there is no "backdoor path" from X to Y that would bias our estimate, hence the estimate X->Y is an unbiased causal estimate -- again, conditional on our DAG.]

For now, we can enrich our language for causal inference by considering the concept of `d-connected` and `d-separated`:

Two variables are `d-connected` if information flows between them (condional on the graph), and they are `d-separated` if they are conditionally independent of each other.

```{r}
# use this code to examine d-connectedness
ggdag::ggdag_dconnected(dag_1)
```

In this case, d-connection is a good thing because we can estimate the causal effect of X on Y. In other cases, d-connection will spoil the model. We have seen this for omitted variable bias. X and Y are d-separated conditional on Z, and that's our motivation for including Z! These concepts are tricky, but they get easier with practice. 

To add some grit to our exploration of mediation lets simulate data that are consistent with our mediation DAG


```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
N <- 100
x <- rnorm(N)# sim x
m <- rnorm(N , x) # sim X -> M
y <- rnorm(N , x + m) # sim M -> Y
df2 <- data.frame(x, m, y)

df2 <- df2 %>%
  dplyr::mutate(x_s = scale(x),
                m_s = scale(m))
```


First we ask, is X is related to Y?

```{r}
m2 <- lm(y ~ x_s, data = df2)
parameters::model_parameters(m2)
```

Yes.

Next we ask, Is X related to Y conditional on M? 

```{r}
m2 <- lm(y ~ x_s + m_s, data = df2)
parameters::model_parameters(m2)
```

Yes, but notice this is a different question. The effect of X is attenuated because M contributes to the causal effect of Y. 

A mediation model would tell us the same. Recall from lecture 9 we can write a mediation model as follows:


```{r}
path_m <- brms::bf(m_s ~ x_s)
path_y <- brms::bf(y ~ x_s + m_s)

m1 <- brms::brm(
  path_m + path_y + set_rescor(FALSE),
  data = df2,
  file = here::here("models", "mediation-lect11-1")
)

parameters::model_parameters(m1)
```

Recalling:

```{r}
bmlm::mlm_path_plot(xlab = "Focal\n(X)",
              mlab = "Mediator\n(M)",
              ylab = "Outcome\n(Y)")
```

For a mediation model we may recover the indirect, direct and total effects as follow:

```{r}
# get posterior distributions
post <- brms::posterior_samples(m1)

# sum and multiply the posterior distributions to obain parameter estimates
post2 <- post %>% 
  transmute(
    a = b_ms_x_s ,
    b = b_y_m_s,
    cp = b_y_x_s,
    me = a * b,
    c = cp + me#,
   # pme = me / c
  )

# plot the results
mcmc_intervals(post2) 
```

So we can ask how X affects Y  in relation to X's effect on M. 

However, to obtain an unbiased causal estimate of X on Y we only needed to include X We didn't need to condition on M to estimate the *causal* effect of X.

## Pipe confounding (full mediation)

Suppose we are interested in the effect of x on y, in a scenario when m fully mediates the relationship of x on y.

```{r}
mediation_triangle(
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  m = NULL,
  x_y_associated = FALSE
) %>%
  ggdag()
```

What variables do we need to include to obtain an unbiased estimate of X on Y?

Let's fill out this example out by imagining an experiment. 

Suppose we want to know whether a ritual action condition (X) influences charity (Y). We have good reason to assume the effect of X on Y happens *entirely* through perceived social cohesion (M):  

X$\to$M$\to$Z or 
ritual $\to$ social cohesion $\to$ charity

Lets simulate some data

```{r}
set.seed(123)
# Participants
N <-100

# initial charitable giving
c0 <- rnorm(N ,10 ,2)

# assign treatments and simulate charitable giving and increase in social cohesion
ritual <- rep( 0:1 , each = N/2 )
cohesion <- ritual * rnorm(N,.5,.2)

# increase in charity
c1 <- c0 + ritual * cohesion 

# dataframe
d <- data.frame( c0 = c0 , 
                 c1=c1 , 
                 ritual = ritual , 
                 cohesion = cohesion )

# this code is handy from the rethinking package
rethinking::precis(d)
```

Does the ritual increase charity?

If we only include the ritual condition in the model, we find that ritual condition reliable predicts increases in charitable giving:

```{r}
parameters::model_parameters(
  lm(c1 ~  c0 + ritual, data = d)
  )
```

Does the ritual increase charity adjusting for levels of social cohesion?

```{r}
parameters::model_parameters(
  lm(c1 ~  c0 + ritual + cohesion, data = d)
  )
```

The answer is that the (direct) effect of ritual entirely drops out when we include both ritual and social cohesion. Why is this? The answer is that once our model knows `m` it does not obtain any new information by knowing `x`.

If we were interested in assessing x$\to$y but x were to effect y through m (i.e x$\to$m$\to$y) then conditioning on m would **block the path** from x$\to$y. Including m leads to **Pipe Confounding**.

In experiments we should never condition on a post-treatment variable.

## Masked relationships

Imagine two variables were to affect an outcome. Both are correlated with each other. One affects the outcome positively and the other affects the outcome negatively. How shall we investigate the causal role of the focal predictor?

Consider two correlated variables that jointly predict Political conservatism (C), religion (R). Imagine that one variable has a positive effect and the other has a negative effect on distress (K6).

First consider this relationship, where conservatism causes religion

```{r}
dag_m1 <- dagify(K ~ C + R,
                 R ~ C,
                 exposure = "C",
                 outcome = "K") %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout = "tree")

# graph
dag_m1%>%
  ggdag()
```

We can simulate the data:

```{r}
# C -> K <- R
# C -> R
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
C <- rnorm( n )
R <- rnorm( n , C )
K <- rnorm( n , R - C )

d_sim <- data.frame(K=K,R=R,C=C)
```

First we only condition on conservatism

```{r}
ms1 <- parameters::model_parameters(
  lm(K  ~ C, data = d_sim)
)
plot(ms1)
ms1
```

Next, only religion:

```{r}
ms2<- parameters::model_parameters(
  lm(K  ~ R, data = d_sim)
)
plot(ms2)
```

When we add both C and R, we see them "pop" in opposite directions, as is typical of masking:

```{r}
ms3<- parameters::model_parameters(
  lm(K  ~ C + R, data = d_sim)
)
plot(ms3)
```

Mediation model

```{r}
path_m <- brms::bf(R ~ C)
path_y <- brms::bf(K ~ C + R)

m2 <- brms::brm(
  path_m + path_y + set_rescor(FALSE),
  data = d_sim,
  file = here::here("models","mediation-lect11-2")
)

parameters::model_parameters(m2)
```

Recalling:

```{r}
bmlm::mlm_path_plot(xlab = "Focal\n(X)",
              mlab = "Mediator\n(M)",
              ylab = "Outcome\n(Y)")
```

We recover the indirect, direct and total effects as follows:

```{r}
post <- brms::posterior_samples(m2)
post2 <- post %>% 
  transmute(
    a = b_R_C ,
    b = b_K_R,
    cp = b_K_C,
    me = a * b,
    c = cp + me #,
  #  pme = me / c
  )
mcmc_intervals(post2)
```

Note that when you ask `ggdag` to assess how to obtain an unbiased estimate of C on K it will tell you you don't need to condition on R.

```{r}
dag_m1%>%
  ggdag_adjustment_set()
```

Yet recall when we just assessed the relationship of C on K we got this:

```{r}
plot(ms1)
```

Is the DAG wrong? 

No. The fact that C$\to$R is positive and R$\to$K is negative means that if we were to increase C, we wouldn't reliably increase K. The total effect of C just isn't reliable!

## Collider Confounding

The selection-distortion effect (Berkson's paradox) (From Statistical Rethinking).

Imagine in science there is no relationship between the newsworthiness of science and its trustworthiness. Imagine further that selection committees make decisions on the basis of the both newsworthiness and the trustworthiness of scientific proposals.

This presents us with the following graph

```{r code_folding = TRUE}
dag_sd <- dagify(S ~ N,
                 S ~ T,
                 labels = c("S" = "Selection",
                            "N" = "Newsworthy",
                            "T" = "Trustworthy")) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout = "nicely")

# Graph
dag_sd %>%
  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")
```

When two arrows enter into an variable, it opens a path of information between the two variables.

Very often this openning of information has disasterous implications. *In the human sciences, included variable bias is a woefully underrated problem*.

```{r  code_folding = TRUE}
ggdag_dseparated(
  dag_sd,
  from = "T",
  to = "N",
  controlling_for = "S",
  text = FALSE,
  use_labels = "label"
)
```

We can use the `ggdag package` to find colliders among our variables:

```{r}
# code for finding colliders

ggdag::ggdag_collider(dag_sd,
                      text = FALSE,
                      use_labels = "label")
```

The following simulation (by Solomon Kurz) illustrates the selection-distortion effect, which Richard McElreath discusses in *Statistical Rethinking*:

First simulated uncorrelated variables and a process of selection for sub-populations score high on both indicators.

```{r  code_folding = TRUE}
# simulate selection distortion effect, following Solomon Kurz
# https://bookdown.org/content/4857/the-haunted-dag-the-causal-terror.html
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000  # number of grant proposals
p <- 0.05  # proportion to select

d <-
  # uncorrelated newsworthiness and trustworthiness
  tibble(
    newsworthiness  = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    trustworthiness = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  ) %>%
  # total_score
  mutate(total_score = newsworthiness + trustworthiness) %>%
  # select top 10% of combined scores
  mutate(selected = ifelse(total_score >= quantile(total_score, 1 - p), TRUE, FALSE))
```

Next filter out the high scoring examples, and assess their correlation.

Note that the act of selection *induces* a correlation within our dataset.

```{r}
d %>% 
  filter(selected == TRUE) %>% 
  select(newsworthiness, trustworthiness) %>% 
  cor()
```

This makes it seems as if there is a relationship between Trustworthiness and Newsworthiness in science, even when there isn't any.

```{r  code_folding = TRUE}
# we'll need this for the annotation
text <-
  tibble(
    newsworthiness  = c(2, 1),
    trustworthiness = c(2.25, -2.5),
    selected        = c(TRUE, FALSE),
    label           = c("selected", "rejected")
  )

d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = newsworthiness, y = trustworthiness, color = selected)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = selected), alpha = 3 / 4) +
  geom_text(data = text,
            aes(label = label)) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = . %>% filter(selected == TRUE),
    method = "lm",
    fullrange = T,
    color = "lightblue",
    se = F,
    size = 1
  ) +
  # scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "lightblue")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1, 19)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-3, 3.9), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = range(d$trustworthiness)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  xlab("Newsworthy") +
  ylab("Trustworthy")
```

Once we know a proposal has been selected, it if is newsworthy we can predict that it is less trustworthy. Our simulation produces this prediction even though we simulated a world in which there is no relationship between trustworthiness and newsworthiness.

Selection bias is commonplace. Imagine a world in which there is no relationship between merit and one's tendency to complain about marks. Then imagine a selection process in which people get good marks either from merit or because they complain. What does complaining tell us about the merit of a student?

## Collider bias within experiments

We noted that conditioning on a post-treatment variable can induce bias by blocking the path between the experimental manipulation and the outcome. However, such conditioning can open a path even when there is no experimental effect.

```{r  code_folding = TRUE}
dag_ex2 <- dagify(
  C1 ~ C0 + U,
  Ch ~ U + R,
  labels = c(
    "R" = "Ritual",
    "C1" = "Charity-post",
    "C0" = "Charity-pre",
    "Ch" = "Cohesion",
    "U" = "Religiousness (Unmeasured)"
  ),
  exposure = "R",
  outcome = "C1",
  latent = "U"
) %>%
  control_for(c("Ch","C0"))  

dag_ex2 %>%
  ggdag( text = FALSE,
    use_labels = "label")
```

How do we avoid collider bias here?

Note what happens if we condition on cohesion?

```{r}
dag_ex2 %>%
  ggdag_collider(
    text = FALSE,
    use_labels = "label"
  )  +
  ggtitle("Cohesion is a collider that opens a path from ritual to charity")
```

Don't condition on a post-treatment variable!

```{r}
dag_ex3 <- dagify(
  C1 ~ C0,
  C1 ~ U,
  Ch ~ U + R,
  labels = c(
    "R" = "Ritual",
    "C1" = "Charity-post",
    "C0" = "Charity-pre",
    "Ch" = "Cohesion",
    "U" = "Religiousness (Unmeasured)"
  ),
  exposure = "R",
  outcome = "C1",
  latent = "U"
)
ggdag_adjustment_set(dag_ex3)
```

## Taxonomy of confounding

There is good news. Ultimately are only four basic types of confounding:

### The Fork (omitted variable bias)

```{r}
confounder_triangle(x = "Coffee",
                    y = "Lung Cancer",
                    z = "Smoking") %>%
  ggdag_dconnected(text = FALSE,
                   use_labels = "label")
```

### The Pipe (fully mediated effects)

```{r}
mediation_triangle(
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  m = NULL,
  x_y_associated = FALSE
) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout = "nicely") %>%
  ggdag()
```

### The Collider

```{r}
collider_triangle() %>%
  ggdag_dseparated(controlling_for = "m")
```

### The Descendant

If we "control for" a descendant of a collider, we will introduce collider bias.

```{r}
dag_sd <- dagify(
  Z ~ X,
  Z ~ Y,
  D ~ Z,
  labels = c(
    "Z" = "Collider",
    "D" = "Descendant",
    "X" = "X",
    "Y" = "Y"
  ),
  exposure = "X",
  outcome = "Y"
) %>%
  control_for("D") 

dag_sd %>%
  ggdag_dseparated(
    from = "X",
    to = "Y",
    controlling_for = "D",
    text = FALSE,
    use_labels = "label"
  )  +

## Rules for avoiding confounding

From *Statistical Rethinking*, p.286

> List all of the paths connecting X (the potential cause of interest) and Y (the outcome).

> Classify each path by whether it is open or closed. A path is open unless it contains a collider.

> Classify each path by whether it is a backdoor path. A backdoor path has an arrow entering X.

> If there are any open backdoor paths, decide which variable(s) to condition on to close it (if possible).

Practically speaking this can be very difficult.We often have many paths to consider:

Briefly, here is an example from a cross cultural experiment I was part of this year:

```{r}
# Susan's model
# call ggdag model
# write relationships:

library(ggdag)
dg_1 <- ggdag::dagify(
  b ~  im + ordr + rel + sr  + st,
  rel ~  age + ses + edu + male + cny,
  ses ~ cny + edu + age,
  edu ~ cny + male + age,
  im ~ mem + rel + cny,
  mem ~ age + edu + ordr,
  exposure = "sr",
  outcome = "b",
  labels = c(
    "b" = "statement credibility",
    "sr" = "source",
    "st" = "statement",
    "im" = "importance",
    "mem" = "memory",
    "s" = "source",
    "rel" = "religious",
    "cny" = "country",
    "mem" = "memory",
    "male" = "male",
    "ordr" = "presentation order",
    "ses" = "perceived SES",
    "edu" = "education",
    "age" = "age"
  )
) %>%
  control_for("rel")
```

Note the colliders induced from the "controls" that we had included in the study:

```{r}
p3 <- ggdag::ggdag_dseparated(
  dg_1,
  from = "sr",
  to = "b",
  controlling_for = c("ses", "age", "cny", "im", "edu", "mem", "male", "rel"),
  text = FALSE,
  use_labels  = "label"
) +
  theme_dag_blank() +
  labs(title = "Collider Confounding occurs when we `control for` a bunch of variables")
p3
```

How do we fix the problem? Think hard about the causal network and let `ggdag` do the work.

```{r}
# find adjustment set
p2 <- ggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set(dg_1,
                                  text = FALSE,
                                  use_labels  = "label") +
  theme_dag_blank() +
  labs(title = "Adjustment set",
       subtite = "Model for Source credibility from belief ")
p2
```

## Inference depends on assumptions that are not contained in the data.

> regression itself does not provide the evidence you need to justify a causal model. Instead, you need some science." -- Richard McElreath: "Statistical Rethinking, Chapter 6"

> "...the data alone can never tell you which causal model is correct"- Richard McElreath: "Statistical Rethinking" Chapter 5

> "The parameter estimates will always depend upon what you believe about the causal model, because typically several (or very many) causal models are consistent with any one set of parameter estimates." "Statistical Rethinking" Chapter 5


Suppose we assume that the source condition affects religion, say through priming. We then have the following dag:

```{r}
## adding religion to effect on edu
dg_3 <- ggdag::dagify(
  b ~  im + ordr + rel  + st + sr,
  rel ~  age + ses + edu + male + cny + sr,
  ses ~ cny + edu + age,
  edu ~ cny + male + age,
  im ~ mem + rel + cny,
  mem ~ age + edu + ordr,
  exposure = "rel",
  outcome = "b",
  labels = c(
    "b" = "statement credibility",
    "sr" = "source",
    "st" = "statement",
    "im" = "importance",
    "mem" = "memory",
    "s" = "source",
    "rel" = "religious",
    "cny" = "country",
    "mem" = "memory",
    "male" = "male",
    "ordr" = "presentation order",
    "ses" = "perceived SES",
    "edu" = "education",
    "age" = "age"
   )
)%>%
  control_for("rel")

ggdag(dg_3, text = FALSE, use_labels  = "label")
```

We turn to our trusted oracle, and and ask: "What do we condition on to obtain an unbiased causal estimate?"

The oracle replies:

```{r}
ggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set(
  dg_3,
  exposure = "sr",
  outcome = "b",
  text = FALSE,
  use_labels  = "label"
) +
  theme_dag_blank() +
  labs(title = "Adjustment set",
       subtite = "Model for Source credibility from belief ")
```

Your data cannot answer your question.

## More examples of counfounding/de-confounding

Here's another example from recent NZAVS research

```{r}
tidy_ggdag <- dagify(
  WB ~ belief + age_within + age_between + partner + nzdep + urban + male + pols + empl,
  WB ~~ partner,
  belief ~ age_within + age_between + male + ethn,
  partner ~ nzdep + age_within + age_between + belief, 
  nzdep ~ empl + age_within + age_between,
  pols ~ age_within + age_between + empl + ethn,
  empl ~  edu + ethn + age_within + age_between,
  exposure =  "belief",
  outcome =   "WB")%>%
  tidy_dagitty()

# graph
tidy_ggdag %>%
  ggdag()
```

We can examine which variables to select, conditional on the causal assumptions of this dag


```{r}
# graph adjustment sets
ggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set(tidy_ggdag, node_size = 14) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") + theme_dag_blank()
```

This method reveals two adjustments sets: {age, employment, male,
political conservativism, and time}, and {age, ethnicty, male, and
time.} We report the second set because employment is likely to contain
more measurement error: some are not employed because they cannot find
employment, others because they are not seeking employment (e.g.
retirement).

### Unmeasured causes

Return to the previous example of R and C on K6 distress, but imagine an underlying common cause of both C and R (say childhood upbringing) called "U":

```{r}
dag_m3 <- dagify(
  K ~ C + R,
  C ~ U,
  R ~ U,
  exposure = "C",
  outcome = "K",
  latent = "U"
) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout = "nicely")

dag_m3 %>%
  ggdag()
```

How do we assess the relationship of C on K?

We can close the backdoor from U through R by conditioning on R

```{r}
ggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set(dag_m3)
```

Aside, we can simulate this relationship using the following code:

```{r}
# C -> K <- R
# C <- U -> R
n <- 100
U <- rnorm( n )
R <- rnorm( n , U )
C <- rnorm( n , U )
K <- rnorm( n , R - C )
d_sim3 <- data.frame(K = K, R = R, U = U, C = C )
```

### What is the relationship between smoking and cardiac arrest?


This example is from the `ggdag` package, by Malcolm Barrett [here](https://ggdag.malco.io/)

```{r}
smoking_ca_dag <- dagify(
  cardiacarrest ~ cholesterol,
  cholesterol ~ smoking + weight,
  smoking ~ unhealthy,
  weight ~ unhealthy,
  labels = c(
    "cardiacarrest" = "Cardiac\n Arrest",
    "smoking" = "Smoking",
    "cholesterol" = "Cholesterol",
    "unhealthy" = "Unhealthy\n Lifestyle",
    "weight" = "Weight"
  ),
  latent = "unhealthy",
  exposure = "smoking",
  outcome = "cardiacarrest"
)

ggdag(smoking_ca_dag,
      text = FALSE,
      use_labels = "label")
```

What do we condition on to close any open backdoor paths, while avoiding colliders? We imagine that unhealthy lifestyle is unmeasured.

```{r}
ggdag_adjustment_set(
  smoking_ca_dag,
  text = FALSE,
  use_labels = "label",
  shadow = TRUE
)
```

What if we control for cholesterol?

```{r}
ggdag_dseparated(
  smoking_ca_dag,
  controlling_for = c("weight", "cholesterol"),
  text = FALSE,
  use_labels = "label",
  collider_lines = FALSE
)
```

> Controlling for intermediate variables may also induce bias, because it decomposes the total effect of x on y into its parts. (ggdag documentation)

### Selection bias in sampling

This example is from <https://ggdag.malco.io/articles/bias-structures.html>

> Let's say we're doing a case-control study and want to assess the effect of smoking on glioma, a type of brain cancer. We have a group of glioma patients at a hospital and want to compare them to a group of controls, so we pick people in the hospital with a broken bone, since that seems to have nothing to do with brain cancer. However, perhaps there is some unknown confounding between smoking and being in the hospital with a broken bone, like being prone to reckless behavior. In the normal population, there is no causal effect of smoking on glioma, but in our case, we're selecting on people who have been hospitalized, which opens up a back-door path:

```{r}
coords <- tibble::tribble(
  ~name,           ~x,  ~y,
  "glioma",         1,   2,
  "hospitalized",   2,   3,
  "broken_bone",    3,   2,
  "reckless",       4,   1,
  "smoking",        5,   2
)

dagify(hospitalized ~ broken_bone + glioma,
       broken_bone ~ reckless,
       smoking ~ reckless,
       labels = c(hospitalized = "Hospitalization",
                  broken_bone = "Broken Bone",
                  glioma = "Glioma",
                  reckless = "Reckless \nBehavior",
                  smoking = "Smoking"),
       coords = coords) %>% 
  ggdag_dconnected("glioma", "smoking", controlling_for = "hospitalized", 
                   text = FALSE, use_labels = "label", collider_lines = FALSE)
```

> Even though smoking doesn't actually cause glioma, it will appear as if there is an association. Actually, in this case, it may make smoking appear to be protective against glioma, since controls are more likely to be smokers.

### Selection bias in longitudinal research

Suppose we want to estimate the effect of ethnicity on ecological orientation in a longitudinal dataset where there is selection bias from homeownership (it is easier to reach homeowners by the mail.)

Suppose the following DAG:

```{r}
dag_sel <- dagify(
  retained ~ homeowner,
  homeowner ~ income + ethnicity,
  ecologicalvalues ~  ethnicity + income,
  labels = c(
    retained = "retained",
    homeowner = "homeowner",
    ethnicity = "ethnicity",
    income = "income",
    ecologicalvalues = "Ecological \n Orientation"
  ),
  exposure = "ethnicity",
  outcome = "ecologicalvalues"
) %>%
  control_for("retained")


dag_sel %>%
  ggdag_adjust(
    "retained",
    layout = "mds",
    text = FALSE,
    use_labels = "label",
    collider_lines = FALSE
  )
```

Notice that "retained" falls downstream from a collider, "home ownership"

```{r}
ggdag_collider(dag_sel)
```

Because we are stratifying on "retained", we introduce collider bias in our estimate of ethnicity on ecological values.


```{r}
ggdag_dseparated(
  dag_sel,
  controlling_for = "retained",
  text = FALSE,
  use_labels = "label",
  collider_lines = TRUE
)
```


However we have an adjustment set

```{r}
ggdag_adjustment_set(dag_sel)
```

## Workflow

1. Import yourraw data
2. Graph your raw data and check that data types are correct
3. Consider your question
4. If causal, draw your DAG/S
5. Explain your DAG's
6. Write your model
7. Run your model
8. Graph and interpret your results
9. Return to your question and assess what you have learned. 

(Often there are many interations between these steps.)


## Summary

-  We control for variables to avoid omitted variable bias
-  Omitted variable bias is real, but also commonplace is included variable bias
-  Included variable biases arise from "pipes", "colliders", and conditioning on descendant of colliders.
-  The `ggdag` package can help you to obtain causal inference, but it relies on assumptions that are not part of your data. 
-  Clarify your assumption.
