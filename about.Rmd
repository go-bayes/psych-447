## Learning objectives

This course offers a gentle introduction to the R statistical programming language with practical applications for psychological science. We start with basic coding and workflow protocols, data wrangling and visualisation, and elementary regression, and gradually progress to more complex multilevel models.  The practical skills you acquire will prepare you for advanced research in psychological science  as well as for work in other areas of science, government, and industry. No prior familiarity with R or computer programming is required.
