1. **Weekly journal entries** (about 100 - 200 words) 
(10 X journals = **10%**)

These are **due every Friday** during term at midnight. All submissions will be on Blackboard, but you may link the Blackboard submission to your GitHub page. (Not our rules!)

Format: you will document your insights, questions, and frustrations in a weekly journal.  This record should include how you have sought help to address your questions, and how you have offered help. The purpose of the journals are to cultivate skills for interacting with the R community, and for documenting the research process. 
  
2. **Weekly workbook problem sets** 

You will find the problem sets at the end of a given week's  lecture page.  E.g. the first problem set is at the end of this page:
https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-447/posts/1_1/
(10 x problem sets **= 50%**)

We will have 12 problem sets, but you will only be marked on your best 10. This means there are two weeks during the trimester in which you will not need to do the problem sets

Problem sets are also **due every Friday** during term at midnight. Submit on Blackboard (e.g. a url to your GitHub page).


3. **Final project** consisting of:

  - 1 x short report of an analysis of a research question using a dataset (project due May 31): 35%
  - 1 x github website profiling your CV (project due May 31): 5%
  
  **= 40%**

The final project will be due 31st May 2021. Eventually, you will find materials to help you with you final project on this page [TBA](https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-447/assessments.html).
